They headed to the base of Chuco Thirteen, the gang <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10763\" href=\"/paco/4005-10763/\" slug=\"paco\">Paco</a> is a member of, looking for the teenager who promptly flees at the sight of them. Making quick work of the gang, Plasmus secured their leader for Silverback to interrogate, promising to kill everybody who even heard of the gang unless he provided information on Paco. When they didn't find him at the motel, Silverback planted a motion detector under the bed and returned when it was activated. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\" href=\"/blue-beetle/4005-4438/\" slug=\"blue-beetle\">Blue Beetle</a> interrupted them and much of Silverback's systems were knocked offline by his attack.

He tried to convince the paramedics to take him when they came for Paco, but Blue Beetle flew him to an abandoned building. He left for the hospital, but Silverback pleaded for his help as he revealed that he wasn't a robot, but he had simply downloaded his mind into that form. His mind would become trapped in the body if it didn't transfer soon, but Blue Beetle paid no heed to his words and left him in the decrepit building.</p>",

When Shinji tells Asuka about this, she tells him that it’s because Hikari likes Toji.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2012778-hikari_and_toji.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2012778\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88194444444444\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2012778-hikari_and_toji.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2012778\"><img alt=\"Hikari imagines Toji enjoying the lunch she's preparing for him, unaware he was just killed.\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/50049/2012778-hikari_and_toji.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/50049/2012778-hikari_and_toji.jpg 432w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/50049/2012778-hikari_and_toji.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Hikari imagines Toji enjoying the lunch she's preparing for him, unaware he was just killed.</figcaption></figure><p>Hikari is later pulled aside by Asuka to talk about her feelings for Toji.

    "description": "<h2>Manga Biography</h2><h3>Volume 2</h3><p>He is a friend of Toji Suzuhara’s and tries to calm him down when he confront Shinji over the hospitalisation of his younger sister. He expresses worry when Toji decks Shinji and tries to talk him out of a fight. When Toji bumps into Shinji again later, Kensuke continues in trying to stop his friend from fighting and fails. The only reason why the pair don’t fight is because Rei Ayanami intervened.</p><p>While in a shelter during an attack by the Fourth Angel, Kensuke expresses disappointment that the battle is being censored. Together with Toji he plans to sneak out and watch it for himself. He is delighted to see the angel when it appears and believes that Shinji is just getting warmed up when he starts off poorly. He is almost squashed when the Eva is thrown into the hills. With Toji, Kensuke is called into the Eva so that Shinji can finish the angel off without worrying about them.</p><p>Later, after Shinji runs away, Kensuke’s the first to notice that Toji’s hatred for him has dissipated. Kensuke suggests he ask Ayanami about Shinji, and after Toji tells him she makes him nervous Kensuke admits to feeling the same. Later, Shinji stumbles upon Kensuke’s tent in the hills where he plays war games. Whilst there he admits to Shinji he’d love to pilot the Eva himself. With Toji, he visits Misato’s apartment while looking for Shinji. He mentions that Shinji must have been deliberately disobeying her during the battle and Misato runs off.</p><h3>Volume 3</h3><p>He is present alongside Toji when Shinji declines to punch him. Later, he and Toji were attempting to get a sneak peek at the Evangelion units just prior to the Mt Futago battle against the Fifth Angel.</p><h3>Volume 4</h3><p>Kensuke is seen with Toji when Rei talks to Shinji briefly. While Toji tries to figure out what’s gone on between the two pilots, Kensuke merely moans about Shinji’s luck with women. After spotting Asuka playing at a game, he tries to get a look at her panties. When she kicks the machine in frustration he only wishes that a girl like her would order him around.</p><h3>Volume 5</h3><p>He and Toji are with Shinji again and he is complaining about how his mid-terms are coming up. They decide to discuss plans on how to study at Shinji’s place, if only so they can see Misato. He’s upset that Asuka had to move in with Shinji, and ecstatic at realising Misato’s been promoted to a Major, calling for a celebration for both of these events. Kensuke is later held back at school by Hikari, to clean up the classroom.</p><h3>Volume 6</h3><p>When Toji goes to the hospital to see his sister, Kensuke tells Shinji that the injury is very touch-and-go. He tells Shinji that he and Toji have been friends for a long time. Later he tells Shinji that Eva 03 is being transported to  and asks if he could mention his name to Misato as a potential pilot. Wondering about who the actual pilot is, he suggests Toji but immediately laughs it off.</p><h3>Volume 9</h3><p>Kensuke returns, playing with a model aircraft. He seems to know that Toji is dead, and upon seeing Kaworu outside the school he feels uneasy.</p>",

Her mothers fascination with stargazing was picked up by a young Annie and this fascination went on to be a career for her. As a child she was skilled in mathematics and further on in her education, in 1884 she graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in physics. Of interest to note is that after a particularly severe case of scarlet fever Annie has loss much of her sense of hearing. This impacted her social life as she was unable to socialize well with people her own age who weren't deaf, but this in effect potentially benefitted her motivation to work and study. Another harsh reality that established itself was the death of Annie's mother when she passed away in 1884. Reaching out to a friend who was the Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Wellesley Collage, Annie was taken on as an assistant. This opened her up to new experiences and realizations about career opportunities and she further developed skills in photography (which had also been an interest of hers, having once travelled to Europe to take a photo of a solar eclipse) In 1894 she went was at Wellesley Collage for a graduate degree in physics and astronomy. In 1907 she received her MA. Whilst at Wellesley, she had also begun studying at Radcliffe Woman's College at Harvard. <br/> <br/>It was at Harvard that Edward C. Pickering hired her to become an assistant. She went on to become one of the Pickering’s women or otherwise known as the Harvard Computers. A group of woman who were to process astronomical data. Other woman included Williamina Fleming, Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Antonia Maury. Out of that group, it was Annie that managed to settle disagreements between the woman on how to classify the various stars they were cataloguing, coming up with  spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, M. O stars being \"blue\", B \"blue-white\", A stars \"white\", F stars \"yellow-white\", G stars \"yellow\", K stars \"orange\", and M stars \"red. Despite the extraordinary work they were accomplishing they were being severely undercut with pay.  Annie has a comprehensive list of awards, honors and achievements. She was the first female to receive the first honorary doctorate Oxford University, she has a crater on the moon named after her. The National League of Women Voters lists her as one of the 12 \"greatest living American women\". Her Henry Draper Catalogue lists approximately 230,000 stars, an amazing feat of dedication and hard work. ",

Overheard by a maid when she was 9 years old and singing as many child might, the maids employer Mademoiselle Lundberg was made aware of Lind's powerful and harmonic voice. Both maid and Mademoiselle Lundberg were astonished by what they considered her extraordinary voice.  It was more than just them who had praise for Jenny's voice and she was enrolled and received at Royal Dramatic Theatre, to study under Master of the Theater Karl Magnus Craelius. <br/> <br/>By the time she was 20, she had accomplished a life time of achievements, accomplishments and honors. Having been the court singer to the King of Sweden and Norway. Starring as Agathe in Weber's Der Freischütz and having sung in opera and on stage many, many times, including such places as the Royal Swedish Opera. Her success was not just limited to the Nordic countries, and her fame and popularity was increased where ever she travelled, including Germany, England and America. Many times though out her life Jenny's voice was at risk as a result of her pushing and working herself so hard. Each time however Jenny had managed to recover. One other notable fact about Jenny Lind was that she was known for being extremely generous, and that a substantial amount of all money she ever earned was frequently donated to charitable services and organizations. A sizable amount of her wealth when she passed went to help financially poor students in Sweden receive an education.",

Homeschool with her siblings she had also acquired the nick name of Pinky, for her fondness of the color and wearing it so often, She did get a brief opportunity to study at a boarding school, however she was forced to drop from out due to insufficient funds. A column in a local Pittsburgh newspaper, the Pittsburgh Dispatch had managed to incense Nellie enough for her to send in a rebuttal arguing against its sexist overtones. Her rebuttal was so impress that the paper decided they wanted her on board. As it was customary for the times, female writers at newspapers often went by pen name's and this is where Elizabeth adopted the name of Nellie Bly, which would go on to become her default.  Nellie was more interested and concerned in covering stories she felt were of importance, such as feminist issues and the issues and plights of woman and ways they struggled, but this clashed with her editors who preferred her to write articles appealing to woman's sensibilities about fashion, gardening and other traditional female subjects. Not one to conform, Nellie became a foreign correspondent, and her first well documented experiences were in Mexico where she reported injustices and poor treatment of the people by the government and corruption issues. Her desire to spread the truth and report on such things almost caused her to be arrested, and as such she had to leave that country. Her time there chronicled in her book Six Months in Mexico.<br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/2012974-nellie_bly3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2012974\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 572px\" data-ratio=\"0.84440559440559\" data-width=\"572\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/2012974-nellie_bly3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2012974\"><img alt=\"Nellie Bly\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55328/2012974-nellie_bly3.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/2012974-nellie_bly3.jpg 572w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/55328/2012974-nellie_bly3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Nellie Bly</figcaption></figure> One of her most harrowing yes famed and successful ventures was when she decided to take an undercover assignment on behalf of the New York World, in which she would fake being mentally ill so she would be sent to the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island which had rumors of treating its patients very poorly and possible allegations of abuse. Dedicated to the deception, she even practiced making crazed expressions and acting a bit off, so she could actually be declared insane. Her experience within Lunatic Asylum was unsettling to her, as she witness first hand the horrible poor conditions and treatment patients were being subjected to. She was cold, fed poorly, was at risk of poor sanitary conditions and was even convinced that many of the inmates weren't actually sincerely insane, or mentally unhealthy, ut of course such a place might actually make them as such. Released after 10 days, her report was published in book form eventually, under the title Ten Days in a Mad-House. More importantly her work embarrassed the employers of the facility and an nvestigation into conditions at the asylum was initiated. Its budget was increased to allow better conditions for its patients.",

Although her family was rich, it was very unstable and abusive situation for Dorothea. Dorothea herself however was herself responsible enough to to look after her siblings and somehow managed to give her younger siblings some stability that their parents could not manage. At school, Dorothea discovered she was advanced in comparison to her peers, and far further in education. This allowed her more time to teach her siblings whilst waiting for her own aged peers to catch up. This itself giving her an appreciation for teaching.  At the tender age of 15, she actually went on to teach a class of children, aided by Edward Bangs. With the aid of her Grandmother Dorothea wished to open a school for girls to poor to otherwise afford education. Another change in Dorothea's life came when she decided to teach a class foe woman in the East Cambridge Jail. Conditions were horrible, and she was deeply frustrated and shocked with how the inmates were being treated. Cold, unhygienic, and stressful living conditions, that no person should be forced to live in. Dorothea made this a legal issue, and fought for the rights of the prisoners, many who were also mentally and emotionally vulnerable. When it came to the mentally ill, Dorothea adopted the stance that better living conditions, could not hurt the chances of improving the mental well being of its patients. This was unfortunately a rather radical attitude at the time, as the general perception was that the mentally ill could not be cured and weren't about to experience pain, cold, or heat. Dorothea was especially humble, she was embarrassed by praise and also opposed moves to name Hospitals after her. As a result many history books tended to overlook many of her contributions, though in recent years there have been pushes to tell of her story better. ",

Home schooled by her father, Elizabeth grew to be extraordinarily bright. Encouraged by both her father and mother, Elizabeth's poetry skills were fostered and nurtured. Tragedy struck for Elizabeth and her family when at age 15 she fell under the influence of an illness which resulted in loss of mobility for the youngster and head and spinal pain. Her illness made her body frail, and vulnerable, and she needed pain medicine to cope. In all this time though, Elizabeth's imagination and creativity never ceased.  <br /> <br />Her writing, particularly her poetry appeared in multiple publications and venues. Famous poet Edgar Allan Poe was a huge fan and inspired by Browning's work. Emily Dickinson, is another notable figure inspired by Browning's poetry. ",

She married John Adams, who was the second President of the United States, making her the second First Lady of the United States. Women's rights movements and slavery were two areas of politics where Abigail payed particular attention and efforts towards. She preached that woman should strive for more than just being married to their husbands, and strive for their own excellence. She famously sent a letter to Continental Congress, a quote from that letter being as follows \".<i>..remember the ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.</i>\"  ",

A curious child, she always questioned her parents about gender differences and why woman were not entitled to the same rights as men? Extremely bright, she was not only the only woman to graduate from Iowa State College, but the class Valedictorian. Experiencing sexism first hand, with her second husband she was able to fight back, aiding in pushing and campaigning for women's suffrage. She held the position of Head of the National American Woman Suffrage Association for two terms.  She was also the founder of the League of Women Voters and also the first woman to receive American Hebrew Medal.",

Alastor's current state of being was brought on by what happened to his sister during the late <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32576\" href=\"/earth-man/4005-32576/\" slug=\"earth-man\">Earth-Man</a>'s xenophobic campaign. Alastor's sister was an exchange student who was visiting Earth when she was attacked. Alastor swore to exact his revenge on humanity by playing a cruel joke on the human genome. Alastor pleaded with a Psion scientist to create a plague that would infect any human within a certain radius. This virus would come to be known as the Hypertaxis virus. The Psion designed a pathogen that would cause a merger between alien and human DNA. Alastor was stopped by the Legion but certain individuals like Dr. Scanlon were compromised.</p><p>Dr. Scanlon became an energy being whose genetic code was now similar to that of a Teallian. At first, Scanlon feels isolated but at as time goes by, Scanlon begins to accept his newfound powers. The Legion member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3621\" href=\"/wildfire/4005-3621/\" slug=\"wildfire\">Wildfire</a> became aware of Scanlon's genetic alteration when he notices an unusual energy signature that was dispersed nearby. The Legion confront the doctor and ask him to come into their custody in order to help him expel Alastor's pathogen from his body. Scanlon doesn't quite trust the Legion so he lashes out at them. Wildfire pities the good doctor and tries to consult him. Unfortunately, Scanlon disregards his former humanity and decides to self implode himself. Scanlon is Alastor's first of many victims that are yet to come.</p><p>Alastor has escaped his incarceration and now he has Carggian DNA mixed with his genetic structure which makes him three times stronger then he was before. Tellus finally confronts Alastor by giving him a glimpse into the future. It seems everyone in the future praises the evolution that the Hypertaxis Virus brought thus turning the purpose of the virus on itself. This mentally breaks Alastor's hatred towards humanity. Tellus has made Alastor believe that everyone in the future considers him a savior who has united humanity with the galaxy. This startling turn of future events disconnects Alastor's hopes of exacting his revenge on the human race. Tellus can only pray that this premonition will bring peace to Alastor's heart and perhaps comnpassion.</p><p>He has recently reappeared with the ability to possess others and has taken over the body of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3622\" href=\"/dawnstar/4005-3622/\" slug=\"dawnstar\">Dawnstar</a>.</p>",

While there Hermes tells Zola of the well known version of Diana's origins before asking what shape Zeus took to woo Zola herself, something Zola doesnt remember, since she's had a number of partners, including a pool hustler, truck driver and some guy that was in a band, explaining that she 'likes men'.</p><p>Later on Zola tries to get in between a growing argument between Diana, <a href=\"/eris/4005-15769/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15769\">Strife</a> and Hermes by reciting song lyrics, which does break them all up in favour of staring at her weirdly, getting her to pipe down again.</p><p>Zola gives birth to Zeke who, as it turns out, is Zeus himself. He somehow used his magic to impregnate Zola with himself to break the curse in which the First Born son would Kill Zeus.</p><p>In the final battle between the Amazons, Hera, Orion, and the Male Amazons vs the forces of the First Born, Zeus uses his magic to open a hole back into the center of the earth which Wonder Woman uses to push First Born back into.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Zola was created by <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4050-42953/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-42953\">Wonder Woman</a> writer <a href=\"/brian-azzarello/4040-41586/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41586\">Brian Azzarello</a> and artist <a href=\"/cliff-chiang/4040-3714/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3714\">Cliff Chiang</a>.</p>",

    "deck": "A member of the Court of Owls who claims to be Bruce Wayne's younger brother Thomas Wayne Jr. who was supposedly killed in utero due to a car crash.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>In a story told by Lincoln to Bruce Wayne, Lincoln's parents died in a car accident in his youth. He doesn't remember the faces of his parents - only the pin his mother was wearing the day of the accident, which killed them both. Lincoln made this pin for his mother at school in ceramics. It was a little heart - one side was bigger than the other side was. After their death, Lincoln was a hopeless child. After school, he went to college and \"Gotham City saved him\".</p><p>It is later revealed that Lincoln's story to Bruce was somewhat of a lie. In reality, Lincoln was a member of the Court of Owls, and former resident of <a href=\"/willowwood-home-for-children/4020-57925/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57925\">Willowwood Home for Children</a>, as he was born \"hurt\" due to a car accident caused by the Court of Owls, and was placed there by his parents, who he claims to be <a href=\"/thomas-wayne/4005-3602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\">Thomas</a> and <a href=\"/martha-wayne/4005-3603/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3603\">Martha Wayne</a>, thus making him Bruce's younger brother. He got the alias \"Lincoln March\" based on the street corner of Lincoln and March, where Martha Wayne was involved in a car accident while pregnant with him.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lincoln March was created by <a href=\"/scott-snyder/4040-58926/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-58926\">Scott Snyder</a>. He first appeared after the DC relaunch of 2011.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Court of Owls</h3><p>Lincoln March, Gotham's young Mayoral candidate was introduced to <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne</a> at an event Bruce was holding in order to gain support for his Gotham revitalization project. Sometime later, he'd set up a meeting with Bruce at <a href=\"/old-wayne-tower/4020-57625/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57625\">Old Wayne Tower</a> to discuss his support. He tells Bruce that they are very much alike, speaking about the night his parents died, remembering a heart shaped pin his mother used to wear. Later, he continues and speaks about the threats recently made on Bruce's life, supposedly placed by the <a href=\"/court-of-owls/4060-58693/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58693\">Court of Owls</a>, a society of urban legend within Gotham. Before Lincoln can say too much, the two are attacked by the <a href=\"/talon/4005-80530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80530\">Talon</a>, who wounded March, putting him in the hospital.</p><p>Lincoln would spend the next few weeks in the hospital, recovering from his wounds, but it wouldn't be the last he saw of the Court. When the Court launched a full attack on Gotham City, known as <a href=\"/the-night-of-the-owls/4045-56675/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56675\">The Night of the Owls</a>, Lincoln's name was on the hit list, and was killed by <a href=\"/alton-carver/4005-83941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83941\">Alton Carver</a>, one of the Court's many Talons. Before he dies, he manages to give Batman a list of Court member names, intended for Bruce.</p><p>When Batman looks into the names of those on Lincoln's list, he finds the Court's secret base, but finds many of the members dead, having been poisoned prior to Batman's arrival. The next morning, unable to let it go, Bruce feels as if something isn't adding up with the Court. Looking at a portrait of his parents, Bruce notices something, that tips him off as to who is behind it. He travels to the morgue to inspect Lincoln's body, but finds nothing but a note, asking him to follow deeper into the \"rabbit hole.\"</p><p>Using clues left behind, Bruce tracks Lincoln down to the Willowwod Home for Children, positioned on Gotham's only sink hole. Inside, he finds Lincoln waiting for him. Revealing that he was a member of the Court all along, and having ingested the serum that brought the Talons back from the dead, Lincoln continuously asks Bruce who he is, and why the Court accepted him into their ranks. Bruce refuses to directly answer the question, claiming Lincoln to just be a pawn the Court could easily manipulate, something that angers Lincoln immensely, as he demands to know what tipped Bruce off to him. Bruce remains silent, until Lincoln screams \"Say it!\" as Bruce finally reveals that it was the heart shaped pin in Lincoln's story, the very same pin he saw on his mother, Martha's portrait. Lincoln then asks Bruce again, \"Who am I?\" With Bruce still reluctant to answer/accept the possible truth, Lincoln reveals that he is Thomas Wayne Jr., Bruce's younger brother. Bruce refuses to accept Lincoln's claims, but Lincoln tells him that he knows it to be true, he knows that back when he was three, he was <i>supposed</i> to have a brother, but then there was an accident, and he was born with a condition that forced the Waynes to leave him at Willowwood, to be forgotten after their deaths. Lincoln reveals the truths Bruce was looking for, the Court of Owls didn't kill their parents, that was all Bruce's fault, and it is something Lincoln intends to take revenge on.</p><p><strong>Nightwing: Rebirth</strong></p><p>March is in Crete, Greece and has invited the members who see The Court of Owls on an international scale. He calls the members the Parliament of Owls and don black versions of the owl masks The Court wears. March is shot through the eye by an unseen adversary. It is revealed to be Raptor and believe March gets in his own way and everyone else's.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Lincoln March has a specially designed suit that enhances strength ,durability and provides flight capabilities.In addition the suit also comes equipped with wrist blades &amp; daggers and also has a grappling line and explosives that leveled a tower. March is also extremely intelligent, and has a vast fortune. He has fought Batman and was on par, if not stalemating/surpassing Bruce in almost all physical categories.March also drank the Talon serum which grants him near superhuman speed and strength as well as a powerful healing factor</p>",

He would spend the next few years continuing his parent's research, trying to find out a way to enact revenge on all aliens.

Seeing as it was a Tamaranean ship that killed his parents, Crux feels that Starfire is partially to blame for the accident, even though she wasn't actually involved. Crux tracks down Starfire in Colorado, where Jason and Roy are dealing with a threat known as the Untitled, and attacks. Knowing he probably can't beat Starfire outright, Crux baits her into following him to a location where he's restored a piece of Tamaranean technology he uses against her. The weapon doesn't kill Starfire, but it seems to depower her.</p><p>Crux is attacked by Roy Harper and is pinned down to the ground. Crux manages to get free and attacks Roy with Starfire. Roy defeats him by slipping from his backpack and setting off its self-destruct feature which knocks out Crux as they fall into the water. Starfire is revealed to have regained her powers and carries Crux and Roy from the water. Jason comes running from his fight with the Untitled and the team starts heading off with Crux's unconscious body.</p>",

She has been shown to be partially vulnerable to energy projection of some kind, which is seen clearly when she is affected by Starfire's energy blasts. While these were enough to slow her down and cause her pain, they did not have the ability to incapacitate her. She also contains the knowledge behind the application of many dark secrets of the All-Cast and the Untitled and she is also seemingly immortal.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Soldier 435 was brought into the Sinestro Corps and joined them when they took over Korugar.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Green Lantern Sinestro</h3><p><strong>For more information see: <a href=\"/green-lantern-sinestro/4050-48993/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-48993\">Green Lantern: Sinestro</a></strong></p><p>While on partrol in obit of <a href=\"/korugar/4020-55818/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55818\">Korugar</a>, Soldier 435 comes across a Green Lantern spying on the planet. He attacks the Green Lantern only to learn that it is <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sinestro/4005-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\">Sinestro</a>. He accuses his former leader of betraying the Corps and attempts to alert <a href=\"/arkillo/4005-45081/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45081\">Arkillo</a>. Soldier 435 is unsuccessful as Sinestro uses his ring to kill Soldier 435. As the Sinestro Corps Ring flys off to find a replacement, Sinestro destroys it.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><b>Qwardian (Yellow) Power Ring which give him the following abilities:</b></p><ul><li><b>Animating:</b> A Sinestro Lantern can will things to move how he wants. The object moved however is often covered in a yellow aura.</li><li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b> : Every ring has a connection to the Main Battery on Qward, which taps into Parallax. It acts as an \"on-board computer,\" telling the wearer what they need to know. It can either respond out loud, or silently directly to the wearer's mind. The AI contains a large database of information that may be crucial to a \"Sinestro's\" success. The ring also translates nearly every language to and from the wearer, which is why the Corps can communicate with each other. When the bearer of a Sinestro Corps ring dies, the ring will seek out a suitable replacement for their sector, someone capable of instilling great fear.</li><li><b>Communicator:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The ring can act as a personal communicator between Sinestro Lanterns. They have also been seen connected to telephones. Weather</li><li><b>Costumes:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The wearer of the ring may create any costume they choose, based on their personal preferences, whenever they choose. The ring projects the costume over any clothes already worn at the time.</li><li><b>Energy Projection:</b> The rings can also project beams, form protective bubbles and force fields, and fire destructive blasts. Sometimes, depending on the wearer, the beams and blasts make sounds.</li><li><b>Energy Constructs:</b> The rings can construct anything the wearer can imagine from hard-light energy, as long as they are willing to make it. The more determined the wearer is, the more complex and intricate these things can be. The constructs can even be so complex as to form working machines, computers, and even people.</li><li><b>Flight:</b> The ring allows the wearer to fly in atmosphere or in space, and can achieve incredible speeds, moving from planet to planet in a matter of hours.</li><li><b>Invisibility:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The Sinestro Corps ring has the ability to make</li><li><b>Mind Control:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The wearer of the Ring can use it to plant post hypnotic commands or control a person.</li><li><b>Mirages:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The Ring can create mirages/illusions.</li><li><b>Phasing:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The ring allows the user to go through walls.</li><li><b>Power Absorbing:</b><b> </b><b> </b> In the JLA's first fight with Amazo, it was GL who defeated him by drawing out all of Amazo's powers. In Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances, Kyle defeated Parallax with SS' power and Thanos with Oa's energy by drawing out all that extra energy from them which made them unconscious. However he couldn't hold all that power nor could his Ring like Hal did with Amazo's powers, so that move isn't often used with so much power.</li><li><b>Probing:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The ring can probe the Lantern's or another person's mind, allowing him to uncover memories or the person's thoughts.</li><li><b>Radiation:</b><b> </b><b> </b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Sinestro Corps member or a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Red solar radiation, which stunts or removes the powers of Kryptonians and Daxamites.</li><li><b>Recharging:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The rings need to be recharged by means of a Power Battery. Other large sources of power may be used to recharge a power ring, however effectiveness may vary. The internal power source of a Manhunter Android is, in effect, the same as a power battery, and can be used to recharge a power ring. During the JLA / Avengers crossover, a Cosmic Cube was used to recharge a depleted ring, although this is not an ideal solution and is available if there are no other options. Members of the Sinestro Corps they generally quote the Sinestro Corps oath while recharging their rings: <i> </i><i>\"In blackest day, in brightest night, Beware your fears made into light! Let those who try to stop what's right, Burn like his power... Sinestro's might!” Unlike the Green Lantern Corps however each Sinestro Corps member seems to use a standard unaltered oath.</i></li><li><b>Temperature Control:</b><b> </b><b> </b> The Ring can increase or decrease the temperature of anything, even something as large as stars, or even create bubbles of intense heat or cold, even down to Absolute Zero..</li><li><b>X-Ray:</b> The Sinestro power ring has the ability to see through all objects without others around him/her being aware that the object has been made transparent. Not all material can be penetrated though.</li></ul>",

However, he is unbending in his honor, which gets him in trouble. At the beginning of the series, he is appointed Hand of the King and thrown into the nest of vipers that is the royal court. He tragically fails at the Game of Thrones and is eventually executed because of Joffrey Baratheon's whim.</p>",

She is originally of House Tully of Riverrun, but married into House Stark; titled the Wardens of the North. Catelyn has two siblings; Edmure Tully and Lysa. As a Tully, Catelyn spent her childhood in Riverrun where she befriended Petyr Baelish. Baelish immediately fell in love with Catelyn, but the feelings were not reciprocated. At the age of twelve, her father, Lord Hoster Tully, engaged Catelyn to Brandon Stark of Winterfell (her future husband's brother). Defiant, Baelish challenged Brandon to a duel for Catelyn's hand. Brandon won, and let Baelish live. However, Brandon died (along with his own father) at the orders of King Aerys Targaryen II soon afterward, and Baelish tried to rekindle their one-sided relationship; she denied him. Brandon's death would be a dominant catalyst for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80188\" href=\"/robert-baratheon/4005-80188/\" slug=\"robert-baratheon\">Robert Baratheon</a>'s rebellion; with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80158\" href=\"/eddard-stark/4005-80158/\" slug=\"eddard-stark\">Eddard Stark</a> seeking justice for the \"Mad King's\" actions. Hoster Tully then sought to marry Catelyn to Eddard, in order to strengthen the family's connections. After the marriage, Catelyn moved to Winterfell, in the north of Westeros. Catelyn and Eddard have five chidren; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80160\" href=\"/robb-stark/4005-80160/\" slug=\"robb-stark\">Robb</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81207\" href=\"/sansa-stark/4005-81207/\" slug=\"sansa-stark\">Sansa</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81208\" href=\"/arya-stark/4005-81208/\" slug=\"arya-stark\">Arya</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80162\" href=\"/bran-stark/4005-80162/\" slug=\"bran-stark\">Brandon</a> and Rickon and for the most part, had a loving, strong marriage. This was put under tension when Eddard revealed he had raised a bastard, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80161\" href=\"/jon-snow/4005-80161/\" slug=\"jon-snow\">Jon Snow</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4040-56499\" href=\"/daniel-abraham/4040-56499/\" slug=\"daniel-abraham\">Daniel Abraham</a> adapted the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, written by George R.R. Martin, into the comic book medium. Catelyn Stark first appeared in \"Game of Thrones\" #1.</p><h2>Current Events</h2><p>After Jon Arryn's death, the Royal Household traveled north at the orders of the new King, Robert Baratheon.Baratheon sought to make Eddard his new hand, to replace his recently dead predecessor. After their arrival, a raven appeared carrying a letter from the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57578\" href=\"/the-eyrie/4020-57578/\" slug=\"the-eyrie\">Eyrie</a>- the lands of her sister Lysa. In it, Lysa stated her suspicions that her husband - the previous hand of the King- had been murdered by Lannister conspirators. Naturally, Catelyn had huge misgivings about Eddard traveling south to King's Landing and taking the position of Hand; but despite her concerns, Eddard had very little choice in the matter and he left for the Capitol taking Sansa and Arya with him. Meanwhile, Bran, her second youngest son, appeared to have fallen from a tower whilst climbing, and had slipped into a deep coma. In truth, he had unwillingly witnessed the incestuous relationship between the Queen, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80202\" href=\"/cersei-lannister/4005-80202/\" slug=\"cersei-lannister\">Cersei Lannister</a>, and her brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80189\" href=\"/jaime-lannister/4005-80189/\" slug=\"jaime-lannister\">Jaime</a>. Fearing for the truth to be brought to light, Cersei ordered her brother to push Bran out the window. Whilst Bran was unconscious, Catelyn stayed by his bedside constantly for a period of eight days. On the eighth day, an assassin (sent by the Lannisters) tried to kill Bran whilst he was unable to act. Catelyn intervened, and managed to subdue the assassin, and Bran's direwolf finished him off. Afterwards, Catelyn traveled to King's Landing to warn Eddard of the danger the Lannister's presented. She contacted Peter Baelish, who advised her to meet him in one of the brothels he owned. There, he told her that the dagger used in the attempt on Bran's life belonged to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80612\" href=\"/tyrion-lannister/4005-80612/\" slug=\"tyrion-lannister\">Tyrion Lannister</a>, the \"Imp\". Her stay in King's Landing was relatively short and she soon left, fearing what her presence might signal to the Lannisters. On her journey back north she encountered Tyrion Lannister whilst staying at an inn, and, with the aid of her sworn bannermen, arrested him for the crimes committed against her family. From the inn she travelled to her sister, Lysa and her residence, the Eyrie, seeking justice. Upon arrival, Tyrion is locked away in the sky cells and Catelyn conversed with her sister; troubled by Lysa's paranoia (since Jon Arryn's death) and the condition of her nephew. Tyrion escaped execution, and arguably justice, by convincing a sellsword to fight for his chance of freedom. The sellsword wins the battle, and by the laws of the Kingdom, is declared free and no longer a prisoner of the Eyrie or Catelyn. Unfortunately, Tyrion's unlawful imprisonment sparks the Lannister house into action; and they declare war on the Starks. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80205\" href=\"/tywin-lannister/4005-80205/\" slug=\"tywin-lannister\">Tywin Lannister</a>, the patriarch of the family, orders Ser Gregor Clegane to attack one of the Stark Bannerman's lands, the Riverlands. In retaliation of this and to Eddard's arrest at King's Landing, Catelyn's oldest son and then Lord of Winterfell in his father's absence, Robb, marches south to meet the opposing army.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>The \"Game of Thrones\" comic is adapted from the book of the same name, written by George R.R.Martin.

    "deck": "Robb Stark is the eldest child of Eddard Stark and the heir to Winterfell. After his father's execution, he is declared as King in the North by his bannermen.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Robb Stark was born at Riverrun to <a href=\"/catelyn-stark/4005-80159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80159\">Catelyn Tully</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/eddard-stark/4005-80158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80158\">Eddard Stark</a>. They returned to <a href=\"/winterfell/4020-57571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57571\">Winterfell</a> after Robert's rebellion, along with Robb's half-brother Jon Snow. He has a good relationship with his younger siblings and developed a friendly rivalry with his half-brother. Robb was also close with his father's ward, <a href=\"/theon-greyjoy/4005-80163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80163\">Theon Greyjoy</a>, who regarded him like a younger brother. He has inherited the Tully looks, having a stocky build, blue eyes, and auburn hair. He is 14 years old at the start of the book series, but 17 years old in the TV show.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Robb has a keen sense of honor and justice, which he received from his father. He is fair, caring, and will do anything to keep his family safe. Unlike Roose Bolton, one of his central bannermen, Robb sees no reason for torture, cruelty, or unnecessary executions and treats his prisoners of war well and justly. He does not wish for violence or war and does his best to limit the deaths and casualties on both sides.</p><p>​Robb has a surprisingly keen mind for warfare and strategy, a trait that takes Tywin Lannister completely by surprise, who saw Robb as a stupid child who hadn't the slightest idea of the violence of war and after his first taste of battle would \"run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.\" The Lannisters were quite surprised when Robb led a stunning surprise attack in the Battle of the Whispering Wood to crush the western half of the Lannister armies under Jaime. Tywin also did not expect Robb to have the determination to send hundreds of his own men to their deaths in a feint to the east.</p><p>Robb is very much his father's son, but this means that he has not only his father's strengths but his father's weaknesses. Like his father, Robb lacks proper political skills and has a tendency to put honor before reason. He married a political nobody out of love, needlessly spurning a badly needed political alliance with the Freys. Robb also put honor before pragmatic political needs when he executed Lord Rickard Karstark for treason and murder, costing him the Karstark contingent from his army. Like most Northerners, Robb is more proficient as a warrior than as a politician and court maneuverer. Much like Robert Baratheon before him, Robb Stark is an excellent warrior and military commander but a bad politician.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The \"Game of Thrones\" series has been adapted from the book of the same name, part of the series \"A Song of Ice and Fire, written by George R.R. Martin. Robb Stark first appeared in Game of Thrones #1.</p><h2>Biography</h2><p>Robb and a small group attend the execution of a Night's Watch deserter. On the return trip to Winterfell, Jon Snow discovers a dead direwolf and a litter of six direwolf pups in the snow. Robb claims one of the pups for his own and names him Grey Wind. Soon the king and his court arrive at Winterfell. Robb spars with Prince Joffrey with wooden swords. Bad blood develops between the two, as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/joffrey-baratheon/4005-81210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81210\">Joffrey</a> challenges Robb to spar with live steel, but the master-at-arms forbids it.</p><p>When Eddard is named Hand of the King, Robb remains in Winterfell to rule in his father's place with his mother's help. After another attempt at his brother Bran's life, Catelyn leaves for King's Landing and the sole responsibility to rule at Winterfell falls to him. <a href=\"/tyrion-lannister/4005-80612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80612\">Tyrion Lannister</a> meets with Robb again after leaving the Wall, but he receives a cold reception from Robb, as he suspects that Tyrion is connected with the attempts on Bran's life. He goes riding with Theon and Bran, who can ride again thanks to a special saddle devised by Tyrion. The group is ambushed by a group of wildlings and Night's Watch deserters, but Theon and Robb kill most of them, taking a wildling woman named Osha as a hostage.</p><p>Following Robert's death and Eddard's arrest in King's Landing King Joffrey summons Robb to pay him fealty and negotiate his father and sister's release. Robb instead calls his banners, marching House Stark's vassals to war. He commands his army to liberate the Riverlands under attack of Lannister forces lead by Ser Gregor Clegane, who were ordered by Lord Tywin Lannister in response for Catelyn's arrest of Tyrion. Robb secures a alliance with House Frey by marrying one of his daughters to gain passage to the region. He arranges an ambush by feeding false information to the enemies, sending a small force to distract the main host under Lord Tywin and attacking with the bulk of his own troops, luring Jaime Lannister into the opening and capturing him during the Battle of Whispering Wood.</p><p>Previously, Robb Stark was a rebellious provincial, badly outnumbered. Not only did Whispering Wood establish Robb's reputation as a strong leader, it destroyed the numerical advantage the Lannisters had held at the outbreak of the war. Moreover, the liberation of Riverrun resulted in the lords of the Riverlands rallying to Robb Stark's cause, putting him in control of two of the Kingdoms and drastically increasing the total size of his army. The after-effects were therefore quite long-lasting, forcing the Lannisters to fight the Starks on even terms, where before they could have simply ground them down through attrition.</p><p>All these battles were only the prelude for the all-out conflict that was soon to follow, with Ned Stark still under arrest there was still a chance for peace with the Starks having Jaime Lannister in captive, if chance happened they could trade prisioners. Alas it was not to be. In a fickle display of capriciousness, the newly-crowned King Joffrey Baratheon orders Stark's executions, in spite of his family arranging him to be sent to the Wall in hopes to prevent the war from happening. With Eddard dead, all hope of peace between the Lannisters and Starks was lost. Meanwhile, Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis have declared themselves kings as well and the Northern and Riverlords debated who they should support. They decide to not support either of them and crown Robb Stark instead of King in the North, making their lands effectively a independent sovereign from the Iron Throne.</p><p>Throughout his campaign in the Riverlands, he proves to be a tactical genius winning every battle he is against Lannister forces, personally leading his men in the frontlines. His tactical prowess, however doesn't help him in the long run; though he makes a crushing victory after another, he commits many strategical blunders that hinders his war effort - when sending out his lieutenant Theon Greyjoy to forge an alliance with the Iron Islands with his father Balon, he betrays Robb and joins with his family that declared themselves independent as well and entered the war by invading the North. Theon decides to, depriving the Starks from their seat and home and leaving them stuck in the Riverlands with the North being overrun by Ironmen. Another one was breaking his political arrangement with Walder Frey to marry one of his daughters to be with another girl (which version depends between the novel/comics and the tv show), which costs him a large part of his forces. Things take a turn for the worse when his mother Catelyn, in a bid of desperation to trade her daughters back, releases their most valuable prisioner Jaime Lannister from captivity behind Robb's back, losing one of their biggest leverages against their enemies.</p><p>This earns her the enmity of Lord Rickard Karstark, as Jaime had slain two of Karstark's sons in the Whispering Wood; Karstark required vengeance for their deaths. In response to his release, Karstark leads men to the cells of Riverrun and murders two squires made prisoners. For this crime of insubordination and killing innocent children, Robb sentences him to death and beheads Lord Rickard himself and immediately afterwards, the Karstark forces desert Robb's army.</p><p>Loosing support of his men very quickly, Robb decides to return to the North and reclaims his home from the Ironborn invaders, but with their army stuck in the Riverlands with the only safe passage being through the Twins, the seat of House Frey - the very house he had slighted by not marrying one of their daughters. He tries to mend relationships by having his uncle Edmure Tully to wed one of Lord Walder's daughters in his stead and re-secure their alliance, with him and his forces invited. </p><p>King Robb was lulled into a sense of security by Walder Frey because he had extended guest right to the Starks - formally eating salt and bread from the same bowl as his guests. To break guest right is to break all the laws of gods and men, thus while Robb and Catelyn were always wary of Walder Frey's intentions, they never thought that even such a despicable man as he would sink so low as to break such a sacred pact. However, after the wedding ceremony and bedding took place, the Freys turn against their unknowing allies in a massacre that was soon to be know as \"the Red Wedding\", the Northern forces are ambushed and slaughtered while Robb is shot several times with crossbow bolts. His mother Catelyn can only helplessly watch as Robb is finished off by his own traitorous bannerman Roose Bolton, who delivers the final blow to her son, before she has her own throat slit shortly afterwards.</p><p>As a final insult to the King in the North, the Freys horrifically desecrate Robb's corpse by decapitating it and sewing the head of his direwolf Grey Wind in its place. The events of the Red Wedding effectively end the conflict between House Stark and House Lannister in a decisive victory for King ​<a href=\"/joffrey-baratheon/4005-81210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81210\">Joffrey Baratheon </a>and <a href=\"/house-lannister/4060-58665/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58665\">House Lannister</a>. Not only was Robb Stark himself killed in the betrayal, but the entire Northern army that Robb Stark led to southern Westeros was also destroyed - save only for those forces of House Karstark which had earlier abandoned Robb to return home, and the forces of House Bolton which turned on the other Northern Houses.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>Robb Stark first appeared in \"Game of Thrones\", a novel by George R.R.Martin. Robb is a prominent character in the series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\". Note that Robb is the only Stark other than Rickon that doesn't have a point -of-view in the book series, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his mother and Theon Greyjoy. Robb is largely a background character in the second and third novels; important events in his life, including his successes at Oxcross, Ashemark, and the Crag, and his marriage, are only revealed when POV characters learn of them or discuss them.</p><p>In the books, the girl Robb Stark elopes with instead of Walder Frey's daughter is Jeyne Westerling, an noblewoman from a ancient but impoverished house from the Rock. During Robb's expedition in the Westerlands his army storms the Crag, the ancestral keep of the Westerlings. Robb is wounded by an arrow and is nursed by Jeyne. While still at the Crag, Robb receives a message that his younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, have been killed by his former friend, Theon Greyjoy. Jeyne comforts Robb in his grief and they sleep together. To protect her honour he marries her the next day and hopes Lord Walder will understand. When Robb leaves Riverrun to attend his uncle's wedding, he leaves Jeyne behind to avoid extra tension between Lord Frey and her husband. After his death, she is pardoned by the Iron Throne, but she still grieves for him afterwards.<sup><a href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeyne_Westerling#cite_note-Rasos14.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a></sup></p><h3>Television</h3><p>Robb also appeared in the HBO television series, based on \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", titled \"Game of Thrones\". He is portrayed by Richard Madden.</p><p>In the show, his character is depicted widely different from the books, sporting typical dark-hair instead of his mother's typical red-hair. He is 17 years old instead of 14 in the books too, probably to avoid unwilling suspension of disbelief and unfortunate implications of a teenager being put in charge of a army. The girl he marries instead is a whole different one made for the show named Talisa Maegyr, that fits Jeyne Westering in all context to breaking his vow to House Frey. In the show continuity, she is a runaway noble from Volantis instead of the Westerlands, that was inspired to abandon her home after witnessing a slave save her brother from drowning, vowing to never live in a place where slavery was legal again. She relocated to Westeros, where she sought medical training and became a nurse. Robb falls in love with her and they marry her. It revealed she became pregnant with Robb's child in the show continuity and unlike Jeyne, he brings her over to the Twins for Edmure's wedding. Talisa and their unborn children are both murdered during the massacre that soon followed.</p>",

Jon has felt like an outsider among the Starks since he was very young, when he learned what it meant to be a bastard and thus why he was Catelyn's unfavorite among the children. The experience made him bitter and left him with a desire to prove himself. When his father leaves Winterfell, he chooses a life of hard duty in the Night's Watch to earn his own honor, he is chosen by the Lord Commander to be his personal squire, in other words he is being groomed for command.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p>In the television series 'Game of Thrones', Jon Snow Portrayed by British actor Kit Harington, first appears in the episode 'Winter is Coming'.

With their army marching south and Tormund's group ravaging villages on south of the Wall, it appears the Night's Watch will be smashed by both sides by its enemies. The only reason they haven't attacked is because Jon gave false intel to the Wildlings saying that a thousand man are staning guard on Castle Black, when actually a hundred are. When they are warned of the mutineers from Commander Mormont's group that have taken refuge in Craster's Keep, Jon proposes a mission to kill the mutineers and silencing before they could be found by Mance's army and forced to reveal the Watch's true number. While, the mission turned out to be successful, in the next full moon the vast Wildling army reaches the Wall. A battle ensues which Jon takes control of the Watch after its commanders become unavailable or too injured to keep orders, and despite the massive onslaught from both sides, the Watch is successful. Unfortunately during the fighting, Ygritte is killed by a stray arrow and dies on Jon's arms. </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4821559\" data-ratio=\"0.62367021276596\" data-width=\"1504\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1504px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4821559\"><img alt=\"Jon gives a northern burial to Ygritte\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 1504w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jon gives a northern burial to Ygritte\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 1504w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 960w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111243883/4821559-4346547769-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jon gives a northern burial to Ygritte</figcaption></figure><p>The following morning, Jon discusses with Sam his suicidal solution to end the wildling threat: he plans to assassinate Mance Rayder, noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army, and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership.

Bran was born in the North, at Winterfell, in the height of Summer. As such he knows little of the devastation that the coming of Winter heralds.

On the return journey, the group came across a dead direwolf, surrounded by her five pups (the sixth, the runt of the litter, was hiding nearby). Several members of the group call for the pups to be killed (direwolves are notoriously lethal), but others suggest that the pups are an omen of sorts. The six direwolf pups represent the five children, and one bastard, of Eddard Stark and to kill such creatures would only bring bad fortune. The direwolf, after all, is the sigil of House Stark. Bran received his direwolf who he later named Summer. Shortly afterward, Robert Baratheon, the King of the Seven Kingdoms, traveled north to persuade Eddard to take the mantle of Hand of the King- a title held by the then-deceased Jon Arryn. The Royal Household, which included many of the Lannisters, traveled with him. The following day, Bran engaged on one of his typical climbing adventures. He climbed to one of the tallest towers at Winterfell, only to unknowingly eavesdrop on the Queen, Cersei Lannister, making love to her twin brother, Jaime. Bran slipped, only to be caught by Jaime, who - at the orders of Cersei- then pushed him out the window. The fall didn't kill him, but lost the use of his lower body, and quickly slipped into a deep coma.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>Bran Stark first appeared in \"Game of Thrones\", a novel by George R.R.Martin. Bran is a prominent character in the series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".</p><h3>Television</h3><p>Bran also appeared in the HBO television series, based on \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", titled \"Game of Thrones\".

She was the youngest of five children. Despite being the youngest, when one of her brothers was injured, Clara partook in care and nursing him back to health, despite only being 11. Inspired by her Aunt  Martha Ballard. In an era when the majority of males were male, Clara helped prove that women were as competent as teachers. She was also one of the first woman ever to be employed by the United States Government. During the Civil War, her frustration and seeing wounded, led her to fight and insist that she be allowed to treat the wounded on the battlefield, even if it meant endangering herself. After the Battle of Run, Clara had set up the means to allow better organization of medical supplies to those wounded and who needed it. Subsequently she was allowed by Army Officials and Generals, greater freedom as far as putting and getting to injured and wounded troops. There were many moments where Clara's life was not just in endangered generally, but rather more specifically, as such wne a bullet grazed her and killed the soldier she was tending to. Barton also played a large part in establishing the The Atwater List, which was a list of the dead soldiers as to help ease the pain of families who may not have known what had happened. This project also involved Clara helping identify the graves of approximately 13,000 men. <br /> <br />In 1869 Clara was introduced to the Red Cross, and concept and idea behind it. Around the same time, she was also trying to establish international treaties and laws, ensuring protection for the the sick and wounded during wartime irrespective of nationality or allegiance and the a establishment of neutral aid that work voluntarily between conflicts. (otherwise known as the Geneva Convention) Though it was Henry Dunant, who founded the Red Cross Movement, Clara is known and respected for bringing and organizing the American branch. Many of her most significant contributions to society came during these years. Her great life is remembered and honored in various ways including dozens of schools, and community centers and even a crater on Venus named in her honor.",

For five yes she was trained as a nurse at the London Hospital, thereafter she was recruited to serve as a matron for the L'École Belge d’Infirmières Diplômées. Before the start of World War 1, Edith launched a nursing magazine, L'infirmière. Once the War started, like many people's lives, Edith's was turned upside down. Belgium was occupied by the Germans. She herself was instrumental in sheltering and saving the lives of many Allied soldiers, even though though her actions this cast suspicion towards her by German authorities. Arrested eventually and found guilty of treason she was sentenced to death and shot. Her death received world wide press. Her last record words were \"<i>Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country</i>.\" There are several monuments, memorials, streets, medical facilities, and schools, all around the world dedicated and honoring Edith Cavell. One other famous quote attributed to her which speaks of her selfless nature is simply \"<i>I can’t stop while there are lives to be saved</i>\"",

    "description": "<p>Robert Baratheon is the head of <a href=\"/house-baratheon/4060-58663/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58663\">House Baratheon</a> and was crowned King of the Seven Kingdoms after winning the War of the Usurper. He is the first son of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont.</p><p>Robert is the eldest of three children, and became lord after his parents died in a shipwreck. In his youth, he was fostered by Jon Arryn at the Eyrie with <a href=\"/eddard-stark/4005-80158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80158\">Eddard Stark</a>, who would become his best friend and most trusted advisor. Robert fell in love with Eddard's sister <a href=\"/lyanna-stark/4005-80204/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80204\">Lyanna Stark</a>, whose hand in marriage was promised to him. Despite this, Robert is known as a notorious womanizer and has fathered several bastard children. He was once a handsome and renowned warrior, but he has become immensely overweight after winning his throne.</p><p>The war for the throne began after Prince <a href=\"/rhaegar-targaryen/4005-80203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80203\">Rhaegar Targaryen</a> kidnapped Lyanna and took her to Dorne. This led to Lyanna's father Rickard and her brother Brandon Stark heading to King's Landing to demand justice from King Aerys Targaryen, who executed them both. Lord Jon then called his banners and both Robert and Eddard rallied to his side. Robert believed he had the best claim among the three to take the throne as he had a Targaryen grandmother. He personally led the deciding battle of the war at the Trident, where he killed Rhaegar.</p><p>Although he had won the rebellion, Lyanna Stark died shortly after in Dorne, haunting him for the rest of his life. He married <a href=\"/cersei-lannister/4005-80202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80202\">Cersei Lannister</a> to unite their two houses and bring stability to the kingdom, though it was a loveless marriage as he was still in love with Lyanna's memory. This earned the hatred of his new wife, who swore never to bear him any heirs. All three of his children were actually produced by the union of Cersei and her brother, <a href=\"/jaime-lannister/4005-80189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80189\">Jaime Lannister</a>, unbeknownst to Robert.</p><p>Though Robert Baratheon became king by winning the rebellion, he cared little for actually rulling. If it were it for him, he would have handed the crown to Ned Stark or Jon Arryn believing they would have done a better job, but his claim to the throne was the strongest because (ironically enough) he descended from the Targaryens themselves. He turned out to be poor ruler, leaving the realm in severe debt and spending his time drinking and whoring. It was only Jon Arryn as Hand of the King and his brother Stannis's effort that kept Robert's rule from collapsing. Only in times of war, he turned out to be truly effective. When the Greyjoys rose in rebellion against the Iron Throne, he felt relieved from the boredom in times of peace and with Westeros' full might, they effortlessly crushed the Ironborn rebellion. This act had further solidified Robert's rule.</p><p>Fifteen years after the rebellion, he leaves for <a href=\"/winterfell/4020-57571/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57571\">Winterfell</a> to ask Eddard Stark to be his new Hand of the King, after Jon Arryn dies under mysterious circumstances.</p>",

As a member of the Lannister house, Jaime experienced great wealth and privilege, along with great power. When Jaime and Cersei were nine years old, their mother gave birth to another son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80612\" href=\"/tyrion-lannister/4005-80612/\">Tyrion Lannister</a>. Unfortunately, their mother died in childbirth, causing their father to become distant. At the age of 15, Jaime was initiated as a member of the Kingsguard, becoming the youngest member in its long history. However, he betrayed this position at the end of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80188\" href=\"/robert-baratheon/4005-80188/\">Robert Baratheon</a>'s rebellion, when he delivered the fatal blow to King <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80206\" href=\"/aerys-targaryen/4005-80206/\">Aerys</a> II. This act of treachery earned him the nickname of \"Kingslayer\". Since their childhood, Jaime had engaged with an incestuous relationship with his sister, Cersei, and eventually, he fathered three children; <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81210\" href=\"/joffrey-baratheon/4005-81210/\">Joffrey</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81209\" href=\"/myrcella-baratheon/4005-81209/\">Myrcella</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81211\" href=\"/tommen-baratheon/4005-81211/\">Tommen</a>.

Jaime Lannister appeared in Game of Thrones #1.</p><h2>Current Events</h2><p>The death of Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, sent Robert Baratheon to Winterfell, in the north in the hopes of persuading Ned Stark to become the new Hand. Jaime Lannister, as well as Cersei and Tyrion, join him. After the initial feast, Cersei and Jaime retreated to an abandoned tower to engage in their intimacies. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80162\" href=\"/bran-stark/4005-80162/\">Bran Stark</a>, who was merely 8 years old, witnessed their union. Out of fear of reprisal Jaime pushed Bran out of the tower, in the hope that the fall would kill him. It doesn't; but the extent of his injuries caused the young boy to slip into a deep coma.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ned Stark accepted the role as Hand to the King, but remained suspicious of the details of his predecessors death. After a botched assassination attempt on the comatose Bran, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80159\" href=\"/catelyn-stark/4005-80159/\">Catelyn Stark</a>, wife of Ned Stark and Bran's mother, began to suspect Lannister involvement. In particular, Tyrion \"the Imp\" Lannister. In retaliation of the Lannister's attack on her son, Catelyn kidnapped Tyrion, and brought him to her sister, Lysa Tully, in search of justice. Jaime, angered by this, launched his own attack on Ned Stark.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>Jaime Lannister first appeared in the first book in \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", entitled \"Game of Thrones\" written by George R.R.

They remained there until Ser Willem's death, when they, once again, found themselves unwanted (having been evicted by the late Ser's servants). Afterwards Viserys and Daenerys wandered the Free Cities in search of aid to recapture the throne from the Baratheon usurper. It was during this period that Viserys came to be known as \"The Beggar King\", and Viserys started to deeply resent his younger sister- blaming her for their plight. This was the first indication of his deteriating mental health (an illness that his father shared), often referring to himself as \"the dragon\" and urging Daenerys not to anger him.</p><p>Viserys and Daenerys then travelled to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57572\" href=\"/pentos/4020-57572/\" slug=\"pentos\">Pentos</a>, where they met a sympathizer by the name of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80207\" href=\"/illyrio-mopatis/4005-80207/\" slug=\"illyrio-mopatis\">Illyrio Mopatis</a>. Knowing that they desired an army to invade Westeros, Illyrio suggested that Daenerys be married to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80210\" href=\"/khal-drogo/4005-80210/\" slug=\"khal-drogo\">Khal Drogo</a>, a powerful horselord of the Dothraki people who offered such an army. Despite his need of an army, Viserys was resentful in giving Daenerys to a \"barbarian\". Viserys, not trusting the promise of the Khal, travelled with the Khalasar. Many weeks pass, and Viserys is certain that Drogo does not intend to fulfill their agreement, which only exacerbates his unpleasant nature. Ser Jorah Mormont, himself an exile from Westeros, tries to explain that the Khal considers Daenerys a gift, and the army - the returned favour- is also a gift, which he would return in his own time. Naturally, Viserys dismissed this idea, and grew steadily more impatient for his demand- taking out most of his impatience on his sister, the new <em>Khaleesi</em> (Queen). An attempt to threaten Daenerys to persuade her husband to give him his army led to Viserys losing the use of a horse to travel. This insult (as the Dothraki held the ability to ride a horse highly) led to Viserys being labelled as the \"Sorefoot king\" or <em>Khal Rae Mhar</em>. Later, Drogo offered the use of a cart to Viserys, and he accepted - unaware that riding in the cart was a greater insult reserved for the young, old and the crippled. This earned him the title of \"the Cart King\" (<em>Khal Rhaggat</em>).</p><p>Upon arriving at Vaes Dothrak, a city which the Dothraki considered sacred, Viserys become drunk and violent. He once again confronts Drogo on his lack of army, and pulls out a sword. As Vaes Dothrak is sacred ground for the Dothraki, it is forebidden that blood should be spilt there. Drogo, angered by Viserys threat, ordered for a golden crown to be made and Viserys, who believed he was finally getting his reward, became delighted at this revelation. However, Drogo melts down a golden medallion belt into a boiling pot, waits for it to become molten, then pours it over Viserys. Finally giving Viserys the crown he so desired, whilst not spilling a drop of blood.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>The character of Viserys Targaryen was created by George R.R.

This union would grant Viserys control of the thousands of men under Drogo, giving him the forces he requires to win back the throne. Upon the marriage, Daenerys was gifted a silver filly and three petrified dragon eggs, long since turned to stone. She was also given three handmaidens named Doreah, Jhiqui and Irri. While initially scared of the Dothraki, she becomes comfortable with their culture and way of life, and eventually comes to deeply care for her new husband. Her newfound confidence, found as a result of her position of power as a Khaleesi (\"Queen\" in the Dothraki language) leads to her losing her fear of her brother.</p><p>Khal Drogo, and his khalasar, traveled to Vaes Dothrak (a city in the midst of the Dothraki Sea) to present his new wife to the dosh khaleen; which was comprised of women who had been Khaleesi, but had been widowed. By this time Daenerys, who was then fourteen, is pregnant with Drogo's child. Daenerys then took part in the \"Stallion Heart Ceremony\", in which she had to consume a raw stallion heart without vomiting. In doing so, her child is prophesied to become the \"Stallion who Mounts the World\", a legendary Khal who will unite the Dothraki and lead them to numerous victories. During the ceremony, she announced that the child would be called Rhaego, in honour to her fallen brother Rhaegar.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844924-2052390_daenerys_targaryen_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2844924\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"2.6758104738155\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:267.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844924-2052390_daenerys_targaryen_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2844924\"><img alt=\"Daenerys Targaryen\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/123851/2844924-2052390_daenerys_targaryen_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844924-2052390_daenerys_targaryen_02.jpg 401w, https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/123851/2844924-2052390_daenerys_targaryen_02.jpg 358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\" data-width=\"358\"></a><figcaption>Daenerys Targaryen</figcaption></figure><p>Later, consumed with rage and impatience, Viserys confronted Drogo on the absence of his promised army. After a brief tirade, Viserys broke a sacred Dothraki law by unsheathing his weapon in Vaes Dothrak, and threatened Daenerys and her unborn child. In retaliation, Drogo ordered Viserys to be held down whilst molten gold was poured over his head. In death, Viserys finally received the crown he so coveted. Daenerys watched her brother die without comment or protest. With her brother's death, Drogo lost interest in his campaign of invading Westeros to reclaim the thrones from the Baratheon usurpers. Daenerys, meanwhile, attempted to change his mind- realizing that she too had a claim, and a reason, to reclaim the Iron Throne. While her words did not persuade him, another's actions did. Whilst visiting a nearby market for provisions, an assassin disguised as a wine merchant attempted to poison Daenerys. It was only Ser Jorah's attentiveness that saved her life; it was evident that Robert Baratheon had put a price on her head, and would not let her live in peace. Drogo, enraged by this cowardly attempt (it went against the Dothraki principle of killing by one's own hand) swore to avenge this by crossing the Narrow Sea and taking Robert's throne for his unborn son.Drogo urged his khalasar east, towards the Narrow Sea, razing the land along with any settlements they encountered as they traveled. Having previously no interest in currency, they sought to capture slaves to fund the provisions needed to cross the sea (as they had no ships of their own). During the pillaging of a small village, Daenerys was alarmed by the actions of her khalasar, as they performed their traditional right to rape any captive women. As such, she gave orders to stop the rape of any woman she saw, and placed the victims under her own protection. Naturally, the khalasar were infuriated by this decision, and approached Drogo to override her order. However, he refused as he was delighted by her boldness - seeing it as further evidence of his son's strength within her. Unfortunately, during the raid Drogo suffered a relatively minor injury to his chest. A priestess by the name of Mirri Maz Duur, who Daenerys had rescued from rape by her Khalasar, stepped forward to heal him. Drogo's bloodriders expressed disgust at this, claiming she was a maegi- a woman who practiced dark magic. Though she was allowed to treat him eventually, Drogo's wound festered nonetheless and he soon became too weak to ride. A Khal who could not ride, was deemed unfit to lead. Drogo's health was paramount to Daenerys' survival. His death would most likely result in the khalasar dividing, with Drogo's bloodriders claiming a portion for themselves; Daenerys and her unborn son would therefore be considered a threat and would be killed. All this was explained to Daenerys by Ser Jorah, which led to her pleading Mirri Maz Duur to save her husbands life by any means necessary. This included the use of blood magic; magic which was largely reviled. Mirri Maz Duur agreed, but explained that only life could pay for death. Daenerys allowed the magic to proceed regardless. During the rite, Daenerys went into labour following a minor dispute by Drogo's bloodriders and their disgust at the use of blood magic to restore him. Disregarding the maegi's warnings that no one should enter the tent during the rite, Ser Jorah carried Daenerys in, fearing her safety should she remain outside.</p><p>Daenerys awoke many days later, yearning to see her son and to learn the fate of her husband. Ser Jorah told her that her son had been stillborn, and had emerged mutated - with leathery wings and scales. Drogo was alive- of sorts- but existed in a catatonic state and was largely oblivious to the world around him. Angered, Daenerys confronted Mirri Maz Duur, who stated that her son and husband's fate was the true price of the blood magic. The maegi continued, saying that she felt no gratitude towards Daenerys for saving her life as she had been raped multiple times by the time she had arrived and stopped her Khalasar. As predicted by Ser Jorah, Drogo's Khalasar had been disbanded into several smaller tribes, each led by one of his previous blood riders. He urged her to flee to the west, to relative safety. What remained of Daenerys' Khas (her personal guard) advised her to return to Vaes Dothrak and become a dosh khaleen (a band of widowed khaleesi). Daenerys, however, had other plans. After smothering Drogo in an act of mercy, she ordered a funeral pyre to be built and for the traitorous Mirri Maz Duur to be placed upon it, along with her husband's corpse and the three petrified dragons eggs. She then asked her khas to become her bloodriders, but all three refused on the grounds that it would be shameful to be the bloodrider of a woman. Undeterred, Daenerys then named Ser Jorah as the first of her Queensguard- which he accepted gratefully.</p><p>Once the pyre was lit, and the flames engulfed the maegi, Daenerys walked without hesitation into the inferno. The strong magic which was summoned upon this act (blood magic of sorts involving the forces of life and death) restored life to her dragon's eggs, which caused them to hatch. These dragons were the first to exist for many centuries, the last being when her great-great-great grandfather had reigned. Daenerys, who was revealed to be the true blood of the dragon, emerged from the flames unharmed in the early hours of the morning. What was left of Drogo's former Khalasar swore themselves to her fully, even his blood riders who then knelt in awe and willingly accepted the gifts they had previously refused. Daenerys had become the first female Dothraki war-leader, a Khaleesi in her own right.</p><h3>Clash of Kings</h3><p>Daenerys named her three dragons Viserion (after her late brother), Rhaegal (after her long dead brother and her stillborn son) and Drogon (after her late husband). She and her khalasar found themselves stranded in the Red Waste, a barren desert, with little in the way of provisions or water. Upon Drogo's death, the majority of his Khalasar were divided amongst three of his blood-riders; Daenerys was left with the crippled, the old and the young, with very few capable warriors. Dany and her khalasar found themselves in the barren desert of the Red Waste, surrounded by the Dothraki Sea, the Slaver's Cities, and the city of Lhazar- all of which posed substantial threat to their safety due to the bulk of Drogo's old Khalasar who had declared themselves as enemies to Daenerys. At around this time, a red comet appeared in the sky, and Daenerys took this as a symbol of the birth of her dragons and her rise to power; the <a href=\"/dothraki/4060-58669/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58669\">Dothraki</a> meanwhile saw it as an omen, a dark prophecy waiting to be hatched. Nonetheless, Dany ordered her people to follow its trail and eventually, they met the old city of Vaes Tolorro. The city, though once again a place which made her khalasar on edge (they believed it to be haunted by spirits), allowed them to recuperate from their journey across the Red Waste. Once rested, Daenerys sent out three scouts to the North,West and East.</p><p>One of the scouts came back with three emissaries from the affluent trader city of Qarth. All three were wealthy, prominent citizens of the city; and all had notable power within its walls. The three identified themselves as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Pyat Pree and finally, Asshai'i Quaithe. They offered aid in return for seeing Daenerys' three dragons, which she agreed to do gratefully. The emissaries then led the khalasar back to Qarth, with Daxos - a influential merchant- offering to house Daenerys and her people in his palace. In the first time in many months, Daenerys was able to learn of the activities of her enemies; it was in Qarth that she learned that Robert Baratheon had died, and that a new king (Robert's son), <a href=\"/joffrey-baratheon/4005-81210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81210\">Joffrey Baratheon</a> had taken the iron throne. She also learned of the Civil War which had ignited between the Lannisters and the Starks, led by the new \"King in the North\" Rob Stark. Whilst in Qarth, Daenerys took the opportunity to gain potential allies and aid, however, it quickly became evident that the residents of the city took little interest in the Targaryen and more interest in acquiring her most prized possessions; her dragons. One of the original three emissaries, the warlock Pyat Pree persuades Daenerys that he can offer assistance. Apparently ignoring the advise of her friends and advisers, she agreed to meet him in the House of the Undying, home to the Undying Ones, who are shades of great power. Ser Jorah and her blood-riders offered to enter the House with the khaleesi, but she insisted to enter alone. Pyat Pree remained behind with her advisers, yet offered her advice on how to navigate the labyrinthine corridors. She drank the \"Shade of the Evening\" as instructed, then entered. The \"Shade of the Evening\" was a concoction which caused Daenerys to experience intense visions whilst navigating the corridors, most of which involved events from her past, or those that held significance for the Targaryen House. Some visions hinted at a possible future, of reclaiming the Iron Throne, of the future of Westeros. Whispers hailed her as the \"Mother of Dragons\", prophesying that the young Targaryen would experience three betrayals, light three fires, and ride three mounts. The Undying Ones in essence showed Daenerys her greatest dreams becoming reality. The Undying then attacked her, using the visions as an effective distraction. Drogon then appeared, and helped Daenerys defeat the Undying Ones, and burned the House to the ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, the people of Qarth then turned hostile against her Khalasar; with the warlocks despising her for destroying one of the sources of their power, and Daxos- who had taken a slight too personally (he had tried to acquire one of her dragons in exchange for ships, but Dany stated that as she owned the last three dragons, that only the third of all the ships in the world would be adequate in exchange of one dragon)- asked her to give back any gifts he had given in good faith, and to leave his quarters. Finding herself with very few allies, she turned to the final emissary, Quaithe for assistance. The Asshai'i gave her sound advice; she must travel further East to gain allies, before returning West across the Narrow Sea and to her home of Westeros. Daenerys then travelled to the docks in search of ships, with the knowledge that her khalasar were reluctant to travel by sea (the Dothraki did not trust water that their horses could not drink). Whilst at the Docks, Daenerys became aware that she was being followed by two individuals, whilst distracted by their presence a Sorrowful Man ( a member of a guild of assassins in Qarth) attempted an assassination, trying to poison her with a Manticore. One of the strangers who had been following Dany interceded, and knocked the Manticore aside before it could deliver a fatal dose of its poisons. With the danger out of the way, the two men - one of which who had just saved her life- identified themselves as a former pit-fighter (and Eunuch) who went by the name of Strong Belwas, and Arstan Whitebeard who was a native Westori now serving as Belwas' squire. They claimed to the khaleesi that they had been sent on the orders of <a href=\"/illyrio-mopatis/4005-80207/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80207\">Illyrio Mopatis</a> who feared for her safety now that Drogo was dead. The two men then said that they had acquired three ships of their own, renaming them Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion after the three dragons that had bought Daenerys ancestor Aegon Targaryen the Conqueror to Westeros, along with his sister-wives. It was aboard these ships that Daenerys sets off for the slave-city of Pentos.</p><h2>A Storm of Swords</h2><p>During the journey to Pentos, Ser Jorah, and to a lesser degree Arstan Whitebeard, expresses concerns about Illyrio's motives for aiding Daenerys. Whilst she initially rebuffed his concerns, Daenerys eventually admits that it would be more wise to acquire an army by herself, without the aid of the magistar. With this is mind, Daenerys orders her small Queens Guard to head to the slave city of Astapor.</p><p>After arriving, Daenerys arranges a meeting with a prominent slave master and part owner of the famed \"Unsullied\", Kraznys mo Nakloz. Jorah advises Daenerys that the \"Unsullied\" are a feared and powerful force, which she desperately needs to be taken seriously by those in the Free Cities and across the Narrow Sea in Westeros. Daenerys chooses to feign ignorance in regards to understanding Kraznys' speech- for he speaks Astaporian Valyrian, and Daenerys, whose Targaryen ancestors are of Old Valyria, grew up speaking High Valyrian (it is her \"mother tongue\")- to better test the slave master's loyalty. As a result, Kraznys openly insults Daenerys repeatedly, relying on his translator to soften his words. Regardless of his motives, Daenerys agrees to buy the Unsullied army of 8000 soldiers for a price of one dragon; her largest and most powerful - Drogon. Ser Jorah and Arstan challenge her decision, arguing that it is her dragons that will win her the Iron Throne and not a slave army. Daenerys does not heed their protests and continues on with the deal nonetheless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p>The character originally appeared as one of the main protagonists in the first book of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" entitled \"Game of Thrones\", written by George R.R. Martin and published in 1996. The series received very little public acclaim, until the release of the HBO television series, which revitalized interest in the books. The character of Daenerys Targaryen is much the same in the comic book adaption as the novels themselves. Daenerys is a \"main\" protagonist in all of the books, with the exception of \"A Feast for Crows\" in which she is only mentioned  twice by minor characters.</p><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494958\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2494958\"><img alt=\"Season 1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Season 1\" src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2494958-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Season 1</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2844909\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.614224137931\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2844909\"><img alt=\"Season 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg 464w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg 396w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Season 3\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg 464w, https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/123851/2844909-daenerys_targaryen_game_of_thrones_season_3_first_look.jpg 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Season 3</figcaption></figure><p>Daenerys Targaryen appears in the HBO television series entitled after the first book of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", a \"Game of Thrones\".
