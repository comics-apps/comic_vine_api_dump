She was born with magical powers. As a kid, she had no control over her powers. Thus she unwillingly raised dead pets from their eternal slumber. The undead pets followed her home, which freaked out her parents. They tried exorcism on her, but the priest died as a result of it. Running away from home, Mary lived on the streets of San Diego for a while. Meeting a boy, who claimed he was named Shadow, she fell in love with him. But when they kissed, her powers drew his life out of him. Afraid, she again ran away and was found by a magician wannebee, named <a href=\"/voodoo/4005-122500/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-122500\">Andre Carson</a>. He forced her to raise an undead army, which she did. At that moment, she was discovered by <a href=\"/shang/4005-21698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21698\">Shang</a> and <a href=\"/sela/4005-57456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57456\">Sela</a> as a potential new student for <a href=\"/arcane-acre/4020-59964/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59964\">Arcane Acre</a>. Mary and the undead turned on Carson and killed him. Alone and still afraid, Mary happily accepted a place at Arcane Acre.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Skylancer is a supervillain in 1960s Chicago, the last of the <a href=\"/chicago-six/4060-61915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61915\">Chicago Six</a>, which was the main supervillain group of the era, starting around the end of World War II. They provide the most significant opposition to the superhero union, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/c-o-w-l/4060-60847/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60847\">C.O.W.L.  </a>Skylancer is a prominent enough antagonist to C.O.W.L. that they use an image of him on their target-shooting range.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Skylancer is a Soviet. He uses advanced technology and weapons, some of which he gets through a backdoor deal with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alderman-lowe/4005-121404/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121404\">Alderman Lowe</a>. (Lowe is sleeping with C.O.W.L.'s boss's secretary, who gets the plans for him.) One day Lowe meets with him about the technology, but C.O.W.L. finds out and thinks that Skylancer is trying to kidnap or kill the alderman.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The union heroes attack, trying to save Lowe. Skylancer blows up the apartment, forcing <a href=\"/blaze/4005-102789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102789\">Blaze</a> to save himself and the alderman, and flies off. <a href=\"/radia/4005-102788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102788\">Radia</a> catches him with her telekinesis, but he blinds her with a flash grenade and escapes again. <a href=\"/arclight/4005-102787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102787\">Arclight</a> grabs him but Skylancer forces his arm to shoot Blaze instead. Skylancer ties Arclight's cap to his own jetpack, and Arclight flies off, out of control. Skylancer falls to the ground and starts killing civilians indiscriminately. The blind Radia, aided by <a href=\"/recon/4005-102786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102786\">Recon</a>'s targeting abilities, uses her TK to snaps Skylancer's neck, killing him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The end of the Six means that C.O.W.L. has no more significant super-powered enemies. This leads the city to want to alter their contract, which Warner and the union don't want, and drives the whole storyline of the C.O.W.L. comic. At the end of the series, someone anonymously mails a gas mask that looks like Skylancer's to disaffected C.O.W.L. member Grant Marlow; presumably he takes on Skylancer's identity in the future.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Skylancer seems to have no powers, but relies on advanced technology, at least some of which comes from C.O.W.L. This includes a winged jetpack, a grenade launcher with explosive and flash grenades, energy-projecting guns, a gas mask, and some level of added durability in his costume, enabling him to fall several stories onto a car and still be capable of combat.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the movie <em>The League </em>(which was created before the comic and whose in-universe history is largely although not entirely the same as the comic) various supervillains are named or appear. While they don't use the name \"Chicago Six,\" presumably some of them would have been in the Six if it had been so named, and possibly would have appeared in the comic if the comic series had lasted longer. They include Big Ivan (who helped created the \"Fearsome Five,\" clearly a forerunner to the Chicago Six), Dmitri Popov, and Nicolai Lennin. Since all of these have Russian names, one of them may be the template for the comics version of Skylancer. (At one point in the comic, a C.O.W.L. member calls Skylancer \"Ivan,\" but that is probably just a colloquial phrase for a Russian, and not actually his name.)</p>",

Stone is suspected by C.O.W.L. of using super-powered criminals, but doesn't let them wear costumes, so C.O.W.L. can't do anything about it.</p><h2> Major Story Arcs</h2><p>C.O.W.L. patrolmen <a href=\"/grant-marlow/4005-102784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102784\">Grant Marlow</a> and <a href=\"/eclipse/4005-102783/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102783\">Eclipse</a> run into a Stone enforcer, <a href=\"/michael/4005-121389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121389\">Michael</a>, and realize he does in fact have powers.  Even though he isn't wearing a costume, Marlow goes after him anyway, and after being beaten nearly to death, kills the criminal.  This causes huge tensions between the police, the superhero union, and Stone.</p><p>Meanwhile, C.O.W.L. defeats the last of the <a href=\"/chicago-six/4060-61915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61915\">Chicago Six</a>, the most high-profile supervillains in the city, and the city wants to renegotiate their contract since the mayor thinks they're no longer needed.  The union plans to go on strike to protest.</p><p>However, C.O.W.L. members <a href=\"/radia/4005-102788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102788\">Radia</a> and Eclipse, tired of the politics, start to go after Stone regardless of jurisdiction and the contract dispute.  They bust up one of his casinos, telekinetically stick him to the ceiling, and tell him to either quit using super-powered criminals, or at least have the guts to have them wear costumes so the union can go after them.  Stone doesn't seem to be impressed.</p><p>With the strike now on, Radia and Eclipse go undercover, wearing masks of their own as they bust up more of Stone's joints, and take on another of his powered goons, <a href=\"/jim-macauley/4005-121403/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121403\">Jim Macauley</a>.</p><p>With the city pressuring the union, C.O.W.L. boss <a href=\"/geoffrey-warner/4005-102790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102790\">Geoffrey Warner</a> makes a deal with Stone: put costumes on his criminals to make it seem like there's still a reason for the union to exist, so they can get back their contract with the city.  In return, Warner needs to pay him, and also stop Radia and Eclipse from messing up Stone's racket.</p><p>Stone fulfills his part of the bargain, hiring <a href=\"/doppler/4005-121401/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121401\">Doppler</a> to rob a store and then kidnap <a href=\"/alderman-hayes/4005-121402/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121402\">Alderman Hayes</a>, and some other unnamed villains to commit other crimes.  He seems more clear-headed on the situation than Warner, wondering what C.O.W.L. will do once Stone stops artificially creating costumed crime after they get their contract.</p><p>Eclipse bows under pressure from Warner, and Radia stops harassing Stone directly, but she gets fed up with the system and stops Doppler regardless of jurisdiction and the strike.  Now Stone is really annoyed with her.  He tells Warner to kill Radia if he doesn't want Stone to go public about their deal, and Warner reluctantly agrees.</p><p>Meanwhile, the union gets their contract renewed due to Stone's goons.  Grant Marlow is fired, due to breaking the rules in stopping Stone's muscle, Michael, back in the beginning, presumably due to Warner's manipulation on Stone's behalf.  Radia quits due to her frustration with the union.</p><p>With the contract deal with, Warner visits Stone in secret.  Warner continues to cross lines he always held sacred, and shoots and kills both Stone and a prostitute to keep Stone from telling about their deal, and for asking him to kill Radia.</p>",

This sends The Basher into a daze and amuses Death; however, Basher just believes this to be some sort of hypnotism. He then gathers everyone in the bar and threatens Death again, who then summons a large bull to tear the bar apart and attack it's customers. </p><p> </p>",

He is buddies with <a href=\"/frank/4005-104245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-104245\">Frank</a>, another hero.  They often engage in semi-joking, semi-serious teasing with <a href=\"/eclipse/4005-102783/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102783\">Eclipse</a>.  They both often show up making random comments about the current state of the union.</p><p>Don first appears at C.O.W.L.'s strike outside City Hall.  They are trying to renew their contract with the city, but the mayor thinks the union isn't needed any more, after they recently defeated the last member of the main group of supervillains.  Don is frustrated with the bigwigs at both C.O.W.L. and the mayor's office.</p><p>He and Frank tease Eclipse about hanging out with the beautiful <a href=\"/radia/4005-102788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102788\">Radia</a>.  Then, as tensions on the picket line rise, Don uses his power to trip up a city official.  The police overreact and hit Don, and a small riot starts, culminating in an unknown hero using his powers to fireblast City Hall, endangering innocent lives.  The fireblast incident becomes infamous and makes it harder for the union to argue that it's there to protect the city, and C.O.W.L. tries to find out who did it.</p><p>When <a href=\"/john-pierce/4005-102785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102785\">John Pierce</a>, a C.O.W.L. member, is killed under suspicious circumstances, seemingly breaking the strike, Frank and Don are there, commenting that he was a scab.</p><p>Don and Frank later see Eclipse in the union locker room some days later.  Frank and Don didn't go to Pierce's funereal because of his supposed scab status, and they argue about it with Eclipse, who did go to the funereal.  They are both also heard making sexist comments about Radia, who tends to not get the same respect as the male members of C.O.W.L.</p><p>Frank and Don later hang out watching <a href=\"/grant-marlow/4005-102784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102784\">Grant Marlow</a>, who is recovering from a hospitalization, practice on the target range.  After Don sarcastically comments on Grant's shooting, Eclipse calls him out for being a jerk, although Don says he's just fooling around.  Then <a href=\"/blaze/4005-102789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102789\">Blaze</a>, second in command of C.O.W.L., comes by, asking another guy, Phil, about the fireblasting at the City Hall.  They're still trying to find out who did it.  Eclipse says that whoever did it, they should keep their mouth shut.  Don agrees, and then Eclipse pointedly asks Frank if he understands.  Frank says he does.</p><p>Later Blaze seems to find out that Frank is the culprit, but doesn't have enough proof.  He asks Eclipse to sign a document swearing that he saw Frank do it, even though he didn't.  Eclipse refuses.</p><p>Don, Frank, Eclipse, Grant, and others celebrate later, when the union is finally able to renew its contract with the city, only to find out that Grant has been fired for complications during an earlier altercation with a villain.  It's revenge for Eclipse refusing to sign off on Blaze's statement about Frank.</p><p>Frank is later arrested for the City Hall incident, although he swears they don't have any proof, and it is unclear what happens to him.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Don's powers are unclear, but based on the spiral design on his uniform, and the one time we see them being used, when he makes a city official fall down, it seems that he can probably create some kind of vertigo sensation or effect.</p>",

His son is straight-arrow <a href=\"/geoffrey-warner/4005-102790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102790\">Geoffrey Warner</a>, who is unaware of his father's criminal ties.  Geoffrey hero-worships his father, and wants to grow up to be like him.</p><p>When Geoffrey graduates from the police academy, he sees his father taking a bribe from the mob.  James says that this is what you have to do to survive on a cop's pay, but Geoffrey is disgusted and leaves the force.  Geoffrey eventually winds up as a private investigator, often looking into corruption in public officials.  However, the police don't respect him and his investigations don't have success.  When James runs into him, they continue to be frosty with each other.</p><p>Geoffrey later adopts the mantle of the Grey Raven, Chicago's first superhero, and tries to stop <a href=\"/the-robber/4005-121397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121397\">the Robber</a>, its first villain.  As the Robber drives away from the scene of a crime, with the Raven holding on to the runningboards, Geoffrey pulls the mask off the Robber's driver, only to reveal that the driver is his father James, now even more fully part of the criminal scene.  Geoffrey beats the Robber and both he and James are put in jail.  James is still unrepentant, believing that corruption is the way the world works.</p>",

    "description": "<h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Note on Detective Hewitt's last name</h4><p>Detective Hewitt was given multiple last names throughout C.O.W.L.  In her first appearance in C.O.W.L. 7, she calls herself Evelyn Thompson.  In issue 8's summary of issue 7, they also call her Evelyn Thompson.  In issue 10's summary of issue 9, they call her Evelyn Frost.  In the same issue (10), she calls herself Evelyn Hewitt on the last page of the story, and the biography on her on the next page gives her full married name as Evelyn Marie Hewitt, with her maiden name being Harrigan.  Since Hewitt is the name used in her official bio, and is the most recent version of her last name used on-panel, that is the name used on this entry.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Evelyn is born in Bucktown, Chicago.  Her parents die when she is a child.  She marries a police detective, James Hewitt, and tries to become an officer herself, but is denied due to sexism.  Her husband is killed in World War II, and she finally gets a job at <a href=\"/c-o-w-l/4060-60847/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60847\">C.O.W.L.</a>, the Chicago superhero union, as a detective, where she excelles.  She eventually leaves the union for unknown reasons and joins the standard city police.</p><p>Three years later, <a href=\"/john-pierce/4005-102785/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102785\">John Pierce</a>, an investigator for C.O.W.L., is killed under suspicious circumstances by fellow member <a href=\"/arclight/4005-102787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102787\">Arclight</a>.  Evelyn takes it upon herself to investigate after <a href=\"/blaze/4005-102789/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102789\">Blaze</a>, second-in-command of C.O.W.L., asserts their jurisdiction over the case.  Evelyn doesn't trust them to do an honest job.</p><p>Pierce was originally going to meet with her when he was killed; he had information that C.O.W.L. was sharing its technology with the very villains it was supposed to stop.  Evelyn is one of the few people Pierce trusted.  She is also the only person who knew Pierce had once been a double agent working undercover as a member of the <a href=\"/chicago-six/4060-61915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61915\">Chicago Six</a>, the group of villains that was using C.O.W.L. technology.</p><p>Evelyn starts a series of secret meetings with <a href=\"/sarah-pierce/4005-121400/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121400\">Sarah Pierce</a>, John's wife.  She wants to find out the truth of the murder.  Their suspicions are raised when <a href=\"/geoffrey-warner/4005-102790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102790\">Geoffrey Warner</a>, the head of the union, talks to Sarah at the at the funeral and says he'd like to meet with her later.  Evelyn also confronts Arclight at the funeral.  Arclight has said that he killed Pierce out of self-defense, despite Arclight's much greater powers.  Arclight flies off in anger.</p><p>Warner meets with Sarah and subtly tries to pay her off after asking if she knows who John was trying to meet with.  Sarah says she doesn't know and takes the money, but meets again with Evelyn after.  Sarah is worried about what will happen if they keep investigating, but Evelyn wants to keep going.  They decide to focus on Arclight.</p><p>Evelyn hits the streets, trying to find someone who might have seen the murder, with no luck.  The other police think she's getting too personally involved.  Meanwhile, <a href=\"/sparrow/4005-104299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-104299\">Sparrow</a>, a former C.O.W.L. member who has left the department in frustration and is now working as a violent vigilante, beats on some thugs who witnessed Pierce's death, and one goes to the police and gives his account, admitting that Arclight murdered Pierce in cold blood.  Evelyn thinks she's finally got what she needs.</p><p>However, when she goes to the DA's office, they say it's not enough; no one will take the word of a criminal over a hero.  However, Geoffrey Warner is still worried, and pressures Arclight (whom Warner had subtly manipulated into doing killing Pierce) to skip town to avoid any future prosecution.  Arclight leaves town on a bus.</p><p>Evelyn is last seen meeting with Sparrow, whom she had been working with all along.  They both still believe Warner was behind it all, but accept that they won't be able to pin Pierce's murder on him.</p>",

She's worried that Warner will leak the news that John was part of the Six without revealing that it was an undercover mission, but Evelyn says that would hurt C.O.W.L. too.  They decide to concentrate on getting Arclight to admit what happened.  Evelyn later gets an informer to rat on Arclight, but the DA declines to prosecute and Arclight skips town without paying for what he did to John.</p>",

    "description": "<h2> Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Doppler is hired by <a href=\"/camden-stone/4005-121391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121391\">Camden Stone</a> to be the first of a new generation of super-powered, costumed villains.  The last supervillain, <a href=\"/skylancer/4005-121388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121388\">Skylancer</a>, was defeated by the superhero union in 1960s Chicago, <a href=\"/c-o-w-l/4060-60847/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60847\">C.O.W.L.</a> a short time ago. With the supervillains gone, the city isn't sure that C.O.W.L. is still necessary, and wants changes in their contract.  The union leader, <a href=\"/geoffrey-warner/4005-102790/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102790\">Geoffrey Warner</a>, makes a deal with the devil: he hires Camden Stone, a mob boss who normally works out of C.O.W.L. jurisdiction because he doesn't hire costumed criminals, to do precisely that: start hiring supervillains so that C.O.W.L. looks necessary to the city once again.</p><p>Pursuant to this deal, Stone hires Doppler to cause some high-profile trouble.  He starts by robbing some newspapers from a gas station, but forgets to wear his mask while using his powers to rough the owners up, so he has to ask them to tell the cops that he was wearing it while commissioning the crime.  Stone has to emphasize to him to wear the mask the next time he goes out.</p><p>Doppler next kidnaps <a href=\"/alderman-lowe/4005-121404/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121404\">Alderman Lowe</a> and holds him for ransom.  Other, unnamed supervillains also hired by Stone start pulling off more crimes.  These acts create increasing pressure throughout the city, and the mayor starts to lean towards giving the union what they want.  The C.O.W.L. members are conflicted.  They don't know about Warner's deal, and think the kidnapping is real, and want to help, but are on strike due to their contract problems.</p><p>Doppler shows a sadistic side, telling the alderman that he may have to kill him.  However, at that moment <a href=\"/radia/4005-102788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-102788\">Radia</a>, one of C.O.W.L.'s most prominent members, breaks in.  She has had enough with politics, and people telling her what to do, and just wants to do what heroes do:  the right thing.</p><p>After a fight in which Doppler breaks her ankle, she beats him up with her fists, instead of using her telekinesis.  Doppler is arrested and taken to jail.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Doppler can, as he says, direct, amplify, and rework sounds, creating a number of effects.  He says \"Doppler ain't exactly the right phrase for it.  But it's close enough.\"</p><p>He can create damage by amplifying sounds to dangerous levels.  For instance, he has amplified the sound of crumpling newspaper to create a disablingly intense loud sound field, and amplified subway sounds to break through a window.  He used the sound of running to break Radia's ankle.</p><p>He can create physical effects with sound.  For instance, he has used the sound of a gunshot to create a sonic shield to deflect the bullet from the same gun, and turned a scream into a physical force that he used to slap a woman.  He turned a scream into a cushion so that he could soften his landing when jumping out of a multi-story building. </p><p>He sometimes turns the drawings of classic comic book sound effects into visual weapons.  For instance, when a man was running away and making a \"klop klop\" sound, he turned the \"o\"s into hoops and tripped the man with them.  Another time, someone said \"OH THANK GOD!\"  Doppler grabbed the \"D\" out of his word balloon and hit Radia on the head with it.  He turned Radia's heavy breathing during a fight into physical chunks of sound that choked her. </p>",

He has an rampant blood lust and wants to fight someone strong. Dr. Genos only releases him as a last resort if all else fails. Therefore he came into conflict with Saitama and Genos when they tried to invade his base. After showing off his speed and strength by easily defeating Genos, he begins his battle with Saitama. The mere aura of Saitama scares Rhino enough to go into his<strong> Asura Mode,</strong> which turns him into a mindless being for a week. Rhino then proceeds to attack Saitama, who is thinking to himself what day it is. As soon as Saitama realizes it's Saturday he one shots Rhino, abrubtly ending both the conflict and Rhino's life.</p><p> </p>",

    "deck": "A slightly sadistic child who tortures toys for fun. He was traumatized after Woody and Buzz revealed that they and Sid's other toys were alive as part of an elaborate plan to escape from his house.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin </h2><p>Sidney \"Sid\" Phillips is one of the kids around <a href=\"/andy/4005-70051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70051\">Andy</a>'s age in the neighborhood; however, the two are never seen to interact with one another. Due to a lack of attention from his parents, especially his father, Sid is able to get away with rather destructive and sadistic behavior, torturing and destroying his and his sister's toys in various ways. His \"villainous\" acts have given him a nasty reputation among the toys such as <a href=\"/sheriff-woody/4005-37411/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37411\">Sheriff Woody</a> and <a href=\"/buzz-lightyear/4005-7848/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7848\">Buzz Lightyear</a>. </p><h2>Creation </h2><p>Sid Phillips was created by John Lasseter for the film <a href=\"/toy-story/4025-754/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-754\">Toy Story</a>. His character is based off of several different Pixar employees who would destroy their toys in strange and violent ways, an example being the melting of Green Army Men via a magnifying glass. </p><p>Lasseter has said during interviews that he is the exact opposite of Sid and acted much more like Andy when he was younger, taking great care for his toys. </p><h2>Character Evolution </h2><p>In the first Toy Story film Sid is seen wearing a black skull shirt and has braces, this is when he is 11 years old. Sid is briefly seen in the third film, <a href=\"/toy-story-3/4025-996/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-996\">Toy Story 3</a>, as a young adult who works as a garbage man. As his older self he still wears his skull shirt. </p><p>It is unknown exactly what effect the traumatic event in the first film caused on Sid or how it impacted him later in life. </p><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><h3>Toy Story </h3><p>In the film Toy Story, Sid serves as the primary antagonist, a name spoken in hush toned by Andy's toys. Sid makes his first appearance shortly after the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, the fact that he was spotted home was alarming to Andy's toys due to the fact that he was supposed to be away at summer camp; however, he was kicked out due to his behavior. Sid's first major action in the film is to strap an explosive device to a toy known as Combat Carl, when the toy explodes Sid laughs maniacally and heads back into his home. </p><p>Sid is later seen at Pizza Planet where Buzz and Woody are trying to find Andy. Unfortunately for the Toys they are trapped inside a claw machine which Sid then uses, winning one of the <a href=\"/little-green-men/4005-86176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86176\">Little Green Men</a> as a prize he spots Buzz and Woody, using the claw to grab them as well, under the impression that they were special prizes. Sid takes these toys back to his home where he gives the Little Green Man to his dog, Scud, as a toy, who tears it apart viciously. </p><p>While Sid has the toys under his roof he performs several torturous acts, one of them including what he dubbed a triple bypass brain transplant in which he swapped the heads of two different toys, one of them being a doll that belonged to his sister, Sally, and another being a dinosaur toy that presumably belonged to him. Sid then later burns a dot into Woody's head while interrogating him about a rebel base, he would've done more damage but was called downstairs by his mother who had just finished making pop-tarts. </p><p>Sid's master plan is discovered when he recieves a large package in the mail, an explosive rocket known as the Big One. He plans on blowing up both Buzz and Woody but a rain shower delays his plans, thus giving Woody time to plan an escape, unfortunately for Buzz he was caught in a depression and played no part in gaining his freedom. </p><p>Once the weather clears up Sid straps the Big One to Buzz Lightyear and heads outside, he sets up an entire space to simulate a rocket launch, pretending to talk to an overseer through a walkie talkie. It is during this setup phase that Woody and Sid's Toys are able to put an escape plan in action, revealing themselves to Sid as being alive and traumatizing him after they swarm him. This event causes Sid to become incredibly fearful of toys, running and screaming into his home where he encounters his sister, Sally, and one of her dolls. Sid was so terrified of toys at this point that he ran from Sally after she shoved her doll in his face. </p><h3>Toy Story 2 </h3><p>Sid isn't seen in Toy Story 2; however, he is mentioned in a speech by Buzz Lightyear in an attempt to motivate the other toys to help find Woody. </p><h3>Toy Story 3 </h3><p>Sid makes a brief cameo on Toy Story 3 as one of the garbage men picking up trash. He sports the same clothing he wore in the first film but is much older than before. He is seen picking up the trash outside of Andy's house and then disappears for the rest of the film. </p><h3>Monsters Inc. Laugh Factory </h3><p>Sid appears in the Monster Inc mini-series as an unnamed child, stealing toys from various children. After he is caught by <a href=\"/mike-wazowski/4005-10608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10608\">Mike Wazowski</a> and <a href=\"/sulley/4005-10804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10804\">Sulley</a> he explains that he was trying to save the kids from the Toys, clearly affected by the events of Toy Story. The monsters ignore this and throw Sid back into his own world. </p><p>Sid later escapes back into the Monster World and teams up with Randall and <a href=\"/henry-j-waternoose-iii/4005-66643/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66643\">Henry J. Waternoose III</a> who promise to give Sid the door-travel technology that they use as long as he helps them gain revenge on Mike and Sulley. Unfortunately for Sid their plan for revenge fails and Sid is thrown back into the human world with the monsters hoping they've seen the last of him. </p><p> </p><p> </p>",
