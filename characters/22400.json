Physically he resembles DC's \"Metallo\" character but little is known of him at this time since the series is just kicking off.</p><p>Ironside seems to be gifted with electrical engineering, mechanics and probably combat since he was a Marine. When he's introduced, he invites Matthew Atherton (before he takes on the persona of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42319\" href=\"/feedback/4005-42319/\" slug=\"feedback\">Feedback</a>) to his garage and shows Matt a high-tech vehicle that the U.S. Army wants to use against a terrorist called \"The Eliminator.\"</p><p>In Issue #1, Ironside reveals himself as the true Eliminator. He tries to kill Atherton but in the process, Atherton actually becomes superpowered. The Eliminator believes his foe to be dead and proceeds with his plans to loot the entire city with his remote controlled combat vehicle. His final plan is to program the car to explode the city's nuclear power plant once he is safely away. Naturally, he is thwarted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42319\" href=\"/feedback/4005-42319/\" slug=\"feedback\">Feedback</a>, the superhero is somewhat responsible for creating.</p>",

Together with them he had several adventures. Like the other members of the Army, his character arc was corrupted by the rogue <a href=\"/seven-unknown-men-of-slaughter-swamp/4060-57067/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57067\">Unknown Man</a> <a href=\"/zor/4005-49562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49562\">Zor</a>.

He speaks to Ystin, and tells them that they must be a shining knight to combat the darkness of the world. He rides the bus of the dead, but decides to return to the land of the living. He seeks out <a href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna</a>, the current possessor of his cabinet. He burns the cabinet to release the necessary energy, and travels with Zatanna and <a href=\"/misty-kilgore/4005-56377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56377\">Misty</a> to meet <a href=\"/don-vincenzo/4005-66320/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66320\">Don Vincenzo</a>, who is dying.

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Tracer has described himself as a \"machine god\" that was created by the artificial intelligences of other machines in order to be worshipped. He claims that he becomes stronger over time as more machines come to worship him the longer he operates.  </p> <h2>Creation</h2>Tracer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40682\" href=\"/peter-david/4040-40682/\" slug=\"peter-david\">Peter David </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-9990\" href=\"/mike-wieringo/4040-9990/\" slug=\"mike-wieringo\">Mike Wieringo</a>. <br/> <h2>Major Story Arcs</h2> <h3>The Other: Evolve or Die</h3>While robbing the Bank of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York</a>, Tracer was confronted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man </a>who sought to prevent the new villain from carrying out his crimes. With the use of his special \"tracer\" bullets however, Tracer was able to occupy Spider-Man long enough to make good his escape.  <br/>Sometime afterwards, Tracer sought to hold New York City hostage by threatening to detonate a bomb unless his exorbitant ransom demand was met. Spider-Man and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\" href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" slug=\"iron-man\">Iron Man </a>managed foil his scheme, but Tracer escaped once again.  <br/>The following night, Tracer infiltrated <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40830\" href=\"/avengers-tower/4020-40830/\" slug=\"avengers-tower\">Avengers Tower </a>after he'd learned from his machine worshippers that Spider-Man was currently living there. While making his way into the Tower, Tracer was also causing cars to swerve out of control, entire computer grids to crash, and a giant robot to rampage throughout New York City as a diversion. Once inside, Tracer met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\" href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" slug=\"aunt-may\">Aunt May</a>, who he introduced himself to as a reserve Avenger named \"Tommy,\" who'd been left on monitor duty while the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\" href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" slug=\"avengers\">Avengers</a> were busy dealing with Tracer’s “machine revolt.” Tracer casually conversed with Aunt May, even telling her of his supposed origin and his plan to kill Spider-Man, until Spider-Man finally returned and attacked the villain. During their battle, Tracer managed to analyze Spider-Man’s DNA and realized that Spider-Man was dying. Insulted because he'd wanted to prove himself by facing Spider-Man at his prime, Tracer ended his assault and reigned in his mechanical worshippers out of a form of respect for his dying opponent. Apparently \"dying\" in some way, Tracer's skin melted away, revealing himself to have apparently been a robot all along. <br/> <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Tracer has demonstrated the ability to communicate with and control virtually any machine and computer, including such highly advanced systems as the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-50749\" href=\"/iron-man-armor/4055-50749/\" slug=\"iron-man-armor\">Iron Man Armor</a>. He can also analyze blood, tissue, and/or DNA samples simply by scratching someone.  <br/>He has shown to be highly intelligent: constantly analyzing and adapting to his situation, demonstrating an ability to think things through even under pressure, and also devising complex back-up plans in advance.  <br/>Tracer's primary weapons are a pair of guns that are loaded with bullets capable of relentlessly tracking and pursuing a target, with the bullets being able to evade and/or go through virtually any obstacle in order for them to reach their target.",

At a young age, it was discovered that he had the ability to calculate and perceive the endless possibilities of a moment. He has a superhuman brain called a hypermind, which makes him one of the smartest people on the planet. At the age of 15, he was a senior in high school and competed in an online quiz sponsored by the Excello Soap Corporation. He won and was declared the seventh smartest person on Earth, receiving the prize of five hundred thousand dollars.</p><p>As smart as he was, Amadeus didn't realize what was really happening around him. The Excello quiz was actually a means used by a lonely, paranoid genius named Pythagoras Dupree to identify potential hyperminds like himself and eliminate them.

Athena had discovered the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\"> Skrull</a> invasion and now claims it threatens the gods as much as the mortals.

However, Artume could not be prevented from taking the Omphalos' power and remaking the world to her wishes. She creates a new universe where she is president over a matriarchal civilization. In this reality, Amadeus is Artume's loyal assistant rather than Delphyne. Things are ultimately set right when Delphyne successfully challenges Artume for leadership, killing the former queen and returning reality to normal. As the new queen of the Amazons, Delphyne informed Amadeus that they cannot pursue their relationship any further, while at the same time Hercules is being told by Namora that she doesn't want to get seriously involved with him.

The immortal son of <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\"> Loki</a> knows of a recipe capable of making one into a true god, and he proposes an alliance with Amadeus to acquire the ingredients, which are Olympian ambrosia, golden apples of <a href=\"/idunn/4005-32545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32545\"> Idunn</a>, the Book of Thoth, and the Moon-cup of Dhanvantari. Amadeus knows better than to trust Vali, so a race for the ingredients begins. Amadeus believes that if he can become a god then he can bring Hercules back.</p><p>After fending off an attack by Thor who mistakenly thinks Amadeus has stolen from Asgard, Cho enters into an awkward partnership with the God of Thunder in order to acquire the ingredients. However, Vali is able to stay one step ahead of them every time. The partnership with Thor soon falls apart as the Odinson confesses he finds Amadeus to be far too much like a young Loki, and Amadeus is forced to trick him so he can reach Vali first. At the last minute, he is able to get his hands on all the ingredients and complete the ritual himself, becoming a god on the level of a <a href=\"/sky-father/4015-55735/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55735\">skyfather</a>. In this enlightened state, he realizes Thor was right and this power cannot be trusted with him, so he brings Hercules back and bestows all of his godlike power on his friend.</p><h3><a href=\"/chaos-war/4045-56257/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56257\">Chaos War</a></h3><p>Hercules, with the power of a skyfather, warns of the imminent return of Amatsu-Mikaboshi, the Chaos King, who will come with an unrelenting army of enslaved gods at his back. The opening attack on Earth is overwhelming and sees most of the population and a majority of the heroes rendered unconscious.

All of reality is being consumed into the chaotic void to which Mikaboshi wants it all to return. Soon, even Amadeus with his hypermind cannot see any way to win. He and Galactus begin working on the means to transport survivors to the Continuu, a pocket reality created by Hera and in which Hercules had been imprisoned for so long. But when the time comes, he realizes that they could not save everyone this way, and he is unwilling to coldly choose who gets to live and who has to die. A new plan comes together in Amadeus' mind, and Hercules forces the Chaos King into the pocket reality, letting him consume that instead. Hercules then expends all of his godly power to restore reality and Amadeus is finally reunited with Delphyne.</p><h3>Time Runs Out</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4123359\" data-ratio=\"0.94122885129118\" data-width=\"1123\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1123px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4123359\"><img alt=\"Cho as part of the Illuminati \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.png 1123w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cho as part of the Illuminati \" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.png 1123w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 480w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4123359-amadeus+new+avengers.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cho as part of the Illuminati </figcaption></figure><p>Following an eight month time skip, Amadeus is seen as one of the new members of the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a> after <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>'s departure.

    "description": "<h2>Origins</h2> Not Much in known about Ethan.In the early 70's he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20097\" href=\"/giles/4005-20097/\" slug=\"giles\">  Rupert Giles</a>(who was then known as Ripper) they along with other friends began practicing Dark Magic. The whole group tattooed themselves with the Mark Of Eyghon. When things turned tragically wrong and one of their friends died. Rupert Giles left the group and they disbanded. Ethan himself turned even deeper into the Dark Magic <br/> <br/><h2>Ethan and Giles Meet Again</h2> Ethan first appeared in Sunnydale as the owner of a custom shop. Though he used his dark magic to curse the customs turning anyone who wore the custom into that (example Xander dressed as a military figure and when the spell activated he instantly knew everything about that rank and all of its association. Even after the spell ended he kept the knowledge). Though sometime later Giles reversed the spell. Ethan shortly returned to Giles after he saw visions of the people who whore the Mark Of Eyghon being killed off. Though this was only a trick and he was using Buffy and Giles love fore each other to hide. He trapped her and tattooed the mark on her and burned his off. It fooled the demon and instead of coming for him it went for Buffy. While Buffy and the gang fought the demon Ethan escaped. A year later Ethan returned to Suddydale with a vampire called Mr. Trick(now working for the evil mayor) called Ethan to curse candy bars that were being sold for the Sunnydale High Band. These bars would make the adults act like teenagers while the Mayor and others performed the ritual to pay tribute to the demon Lurconis. His plan was later reversed once again by Giles. Ethan again returns to seek revenge on Giles. After having a drink with Ethan the night before Giles is turned into a Fyarl Demon. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20096\" href=\"/buffy/4005-20096/\" slug=\"buffy\"> Buffy</a> and the gang think the demon ate Giles and set off to kill him. Luckily Spike speaks this demons language ans is able to establish who he is. Though later Buffy Still kills him the spell is reversed by morning and Giles is unharmed. Ethan was last seen being sent to a detention facility in Nevada. <br/> <br/><h2>After Sunnydale</h2>  After several years Ethan suddenly re-appears acting as a guide in the dreamscape dimension that Buffy was in. Though it appears that Ethan was doing some sort of Astral Projecting. When Buffy found out that he was still in his cell in Nevada she finds him dead. <br/> <br/><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> Ethan was one of the most powerful magic users in the Buffy universe(though no where near the level of users such as Willow). He can easily perform dark magic such as es and transmogrification. Thought the series and his limited appearance he has shown that he has little to no hand to hand skills. Relying mostly on fast acting spells or traps.",

Warren constructed \"the perfect girlfriend\", and android named April who is programmed to unconditionally love Warren.  Warren later meets Katrina Silber, and the two begin to date.  Rather than attempting to explain what is happening to April, reprogram her, or decommission her, Warren decides to simply leave her locked in his dorm room until her internal battery runs down.  Rather than waiting, April became bored and decided to seek out Warren for herself.  She went across the campus asking people if they knew Warren, causing physical harm to anyone that got in her way.  April catches up with Warren at a local club, but he escapes with Katrina before she could locate him.</p><p>The rampaging April caught the attention of Buffy and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41140\" href=\"/scooby-gang/4060-41140/\" slug=\"scooby-gang\">    Scooby Gang</a>.  Since there was only one Warren in the school at the time, tracking him down did not prove difficult.  Buffy came to Warren's house while he was trying to skip town, and forced him to help her stop April.  Buffy took Warren to help her track down April.</p><p>One of the earliest signs of Warren's bad side came out when he and Buffy were tracking April.  Warren told Buffy that April had to answer when he called out to her because of a feedback-loop that he installed in her.  If she didn't respond quickly this feedback would flair up, causing her pain.  Before Buffy and Warren found April she ran into Katrina.  When April learned that Katrina was also dating Warren she became confused, and picked Katrina up by the neck.  Buffy and Warren got to April just in time, and were able to get Katrina to safety.  She was not badly injured, simply knocked unconscious from a lack of oxygen.</p><p>Buffy fought off the super-strong April, and won.  When Katrina learned of what Warren had done she became disgusted with Warren and broke up with him immediately.  Warren was later approached by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20126\" href=\"/spike/4005-20126/\" slug=\"spike\">    Spike</a>, who insisted that Warren build him a love android that was an exact replica of Buffy.  Fearing for his safety Warren constructed the android, which would later go on to take her place during Buffy's death.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>The Trio</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74421/1388246-troika5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1388246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74421/1388246-troika5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1388246\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74421/1388246-troika5.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74421/1388246-troika5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure> <p>After meeting up with a Jonathan Levinson and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43087\" href=\"/andrew-wells/4005-43087/\" slug=\"andrew-wells\">    Andrew Wells</a> the three formed a group named the Trio.  Jonathan had some experience with Magic, and Andrew experience summoning demons (he had trained a pack of flying monkey demons to attack the high school play earlier).  They figured that they could use their combined skills and abilities to steal and extort wealth and power.  Their first mission as a group involved a demon that they hired to help them rob a bank where Buffy happened to be applying for a loan at.  While fighting with the demon Buffy wasn't able to stop the robbery, but she angered the demon who sought to take it out on the three.  After the bank incident Warren and the others decided that Buffy was their arch-nemesis, and that part of their time would be spent plotting her downfall.</p><p>Buffy barely noticed the Trio at first, their antics being better classified as an irritation more than anything else.  They set out on a mission to try to determine whose skills would be best suited to lead the group by seeing who could interfere with Buffy's life the most.  Later, after an invisibility gun Warren developed went haywire, they turned Buffy into an unstable, invisible state.  Buffy learned of what they were doing, and was able to stop them and turn herself visible before any permanent damage was done.</p><p>Things began to really go downhill for both Warren and the Trio when Jonathan developed a spell that would put any woman they chose under their control.  Warren, who had began to push the others around earlier, insisted that he would be the first to try out the spell.  He located his ex-girlfriend Katrina at a bar, and tried to pick her up.  She responded saying that she wanted nothing to do with him ever again.  In the face of this rejection, Warren used the spell on her and took her back to the basement where the Trio resided.  While trying to rape Katrina she came out of his control.  The spell that Jonathan had created was not powerful enough and she attempted to escape.  Warren stopped her by smashing a glass bottle on her head, killing her.  This made both Jonathan and Andrew want to leave, but Warren insisted that they were in too deep at this point, and forced them to help him dispose of her body.</p><p>The three decided to pin the murder on Buffy.  Andrew summoned a group of demons whose mere presence alters the perception of time to anyone close in their proximity.  While they were fighting Buffy this time anomaly occurred.  When Buffy found the dead body of Katrina she believed that she had killed Katrina during the fight.  Buffy was distraught over the incident and wanted to turn herself in to the authorities.  Warren and the others were relieved that they had gotten away with murder until they realized that they had not fooled Buffy, and they were forced to go underground.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Dark Willow</h2><p>Warren knew that at this point Jonathan was less willing to go along with the plans that Warren made, and would likely tell on them.  Andrew was still easily manipulated by Warren, believing Warren to be his close friend.  Warren came up with a scheme that would take care of both Jonathan and Buffy.  The three went to a demon-guarded cave, and inside stole two orbs which would make the bearer invincible and provide them super strength.  Again, Warren decided that he would be the first to use them.  Warren took Jonathan and Andrew around town where he picked fights with the largest people he could find.  During an armored car heist, Buffy caught up with the Trio.  Warren began to fight with Buffy, insane that a woman had caused them so many problems.  Buffy shattered the orbs leaving Warren powerless.  Before she could take him to the authorities Warren revealed a jet-pack he had under his jacket and flew off. Andrew revealed a similar jet-pack which revealed to Jonathan that the two had set him up.  Andrew attempted to fly off with Warren as a big, dramatic gesture, but hit an awning, rendering himself unconscious.  Buffy took both Jonathan and Andrew into custody.</p><p>Enraged that everything he had was falling apart, and blaming Buffy for the mess, Warren purchased a handgun and went to Buffy's home.  He shot Buffy through the chest, and a stray bullet went through a window in the house killing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20125\" href=\"/willow/4005-20125/\" slug=\"willow\">    Willow</a>'s girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20101\" href=\"/tara/4005-20101/\" slug=\"tara\">    Tara</a>.  Warren fled thinking that he killed Buffy.  Willow was distraught over Tara's death and attempted to bring Tara back to life.  Since Tara's death wasn't due to mystical forces, the gods would not permit returning Tara to life.  Willow absorbed as much dark magic as she could and went after the Trio.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879572\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7717206132879\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879572\"><img alt=\" Flayed! \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 587w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Flayed! \" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 587w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34588/879572-warrenskinned.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Flayed! </figcaption></figure> <p>Warren learned that he had not actually killed Buffy, and when he learned that Willow was after him he sought protection from everyone in the underworld that he could think of.  No one would take him in.  He sent an android that resembled himself on a bus out of town as a decoy, but this served only to slow Willow down briefly.

When Buffy and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20098\" href=\"/xander/4005-20098/\" slug=\"xander\">    Xander</a> arrived to stop her, Willow ripped Warren's skin from his body.

From the beginning of the story we are led to believe that he is merely an unusual character. The truth about Isshin Kurosaki is hidden beneath his normally wild behavior, usual banter and awkward social behavior. On the inside, he is a very serious and powerful man.</p><p>As a civilian Isshin owns a small clinic he and his family runs. Aside from Ichigo, Isshin has two other children, Karin and Yuzu.</p><p>Through out the earlier parts of the series Isshin is more of a comedy relief character than the key character he would later become.</p><p>Isshin looks to be in his early to mid forties, but usually dresses like a twenty year old flamingo dancer. Isshin tends to style his hair so that the hair at the top of his sticks up and his side burns look rather neatly trimmed. Despite his attention to his hair Isshin looks like he tends to neglect shaving and has a scruff across his chin. Except for when he goes to visit his wife's grave and changes to his Soul Reaper form Isshin usually wears frilly shirts with or without a doctor's shirt.</p><p> </p><p>In his Soul Reaper's uniform, Isshin wears the black uniform with a shoulder pad on his left arm and his old captain's jacket hanging from under it.</p><h2>History</h2><p> </p><p>In the opening of the series, Isshin is seen acting like a child when he attacks his son for being late to dinner. The surprise attack results in Isshin getting beat up by him. When he and Ichigo begin to argue, Yuzu steps in and threatens to not feed either of them if they keep fighting. Isshin then complains about how Ichigo can see spirits but he can't. After Ichigo leaves the room, Isshin also complains that Ichigo never talks to him about his problems with having to deal with spirits. Karin responds by telling Isshin that she understands her brother since their father always acts like a child. The rebuff causes Isshin to respond by crying to a mural of his wife, Masaki, which he keeps on the wall of their house. When Ichigo finds out that his family is attacked by <a href=\"/hollows/4060-43024/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43024\">Hollows</a>, Isshin is the first to be taken out.</p><p>The next day Isshin is there to wake Ichigo up for school dropping on him feet first. After Ichigo is awake Isshin is the first one to go outside and ready to fix a hole in their wall, cheerfully quipping about how nice it is that no one had died.</p><p> </p><h3>Memories in the Rain</h3><p>On day Ichigo wakes up late for work and wonders where his father is. When Ichigo looks at his watch, he realizes that his father is getting ready for the next day.</p><p>Isshin calls a family meeting and discusses the days plans for the morning, where he points out that he had his hair cut despite the unnoticeable difference.</p><p>When morning comes, Isshin tries to motivate his daughters to continue to climb the steps of the hill leading to the cemetery that they're going to visit. To give his daughters motivation, Isshin balances himself on his hands and begins to climb the hill, picking up speed when Yuzu and Karin ignore him.</p><p>Once in the cemetery Isshin and the rest of the family gather at Masaki's grave to pay their respects. Isshin is the first to suggest a competion between him and Ichigo in Tombstone Dominos, he stops when Yuzu again threatens not to feed him.</p><p>When Ichigo steps in to later stop the Hollow, <a href=\"/grand-fisher/4005-58361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58361\">Grand Fisher </a>from eating his sisters, Isshin is waiting at the bottom of the hill for his family to arrive. Secrets about this story are revealed later. During Ichigo's fight with Grand Fisher, Isshin keeps Yuzu and Karin in a small temple and notices that there is something different about Ichigo. After Ichigo and Grand Fisher's battle is concluded, Isshin runs into his son at Masaki Kurosaki's grave. Ichigo realizes that Isshin is smoking a cigarette, something he doesn't ever remember seeing his father do. Isshin reveals that he smokes one cigarette each year in front of his wife's grave, stating that Masaki believes her husband looks cool while smoking.</p><p>Before walking away, Isshin tells Ichigo that he is proud that his wife sacrificed herself to save their son. Ichigo is left standing in the rain at the end of the story almost awestruck as Isshin walks away wishing Ichigo to live a long and fulfilling life.</p><p> </p><h3>Spirits Are Among Us</h3><p>Isshin is a huge fan of the show, Spiritual Hotsprings with Don Kanoji and he demonstrates it by watching his show religiously and performing the laughing arm cross.</p><p>When the family goes to watch the show live, Isshin tries to get on TV like Ichigo, by trying to jump the security line, but is stopped by Yuzu. After the spirit transforms into a Hollow, Isshin covers his daughters from the fragmenting glass, despite being too far away for the glass to hurt them. Isshin is seen later complimenting Kanoji on his way of dressing himself.</p><p> </p><h3>Battle of the Rubicon/ Right Arm of the Giant</h3><p> </p><p>Isshin is only seen once during this story when he and Karin are looking for Chad after his hard fought battle with a Hollow. After Isshin arrives on the scene and can't find Chad, he thinks that Karin just wants some attention and begins to pester her. Karin is infuriated by her father and attacks him.</p><p> </p><h3>Soul Society Arc</h3><p>Before the four friends and <a href=\"/yoruichi-shihouin/4005-47126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47126\"> Yoruichi</a> take off to invade <a href=\"/soul-society/4020-46356/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-46356\"> Soul Society</a>, the group spends a little time at home during the beginning of their Summer Break. They decide to go see the annual fireworks and sure enough, the rest of the Kurosaki family is there to cause a scene. When the team meets at the river bank, Isshin shows up and leads them to where he has reserved some seats, a lot closer to where the show will be. Isshin also tries to play down the fact that he knowingly drank alcohol filled melons that an old man is always selling.</p><p>The last thing Isshin does before his son leaves is to give him a luck/ fertility charm that his mother had given him. Isshin also tells Ichigo to come back alive.</p><p> </p><h3>Arrancar Story Arc</h3><p>After the teens return home and try to get their lives back in order, things seems to get worse. While Ichigo is off fighting a Hollow and meeting a new student named <a href=\"/shinji-hirako/4005-54764/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54764\"> Shinji Hirako</a>, <a href=\"/kon/4005-46193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46193\"> Kon</a> decides to run off in Ichigo's body.</p><p>Unbeknown to Kon, Grand Fisher is back and has come to destroy Ichigo. After escaping temporarily, Kon is eventually caught and saved by Isshin. It is revealed that Isshin had filled the charm he returned to Ichigo with barriers to protect Kon should he ever be attacked by a Hollow in Ichigo's body. Isshin explains that he has always known since they visited the cemetery, that Kon sometimes stays in Ichigo's body.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263160\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.720703125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263160\"><img alt=\"Isshin battles Grand Fisher\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg 1024w, http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg 960w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263160-m7bleach_ch187_12_13.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Isshin battles Grand Fisher</figcaption></figure><p>As Isshin approaches Grand Fisher, it is explained that twenty years ago Isshin had come to the human world and fallen in love with Masaki and became a human.</p><p>Grand Fisher laughs at Isshin's want to fight him despite the size difference in their weapons (Fisher's is as big as a skyscraper at this point, while Isshin's is about the size of a regular katana.), and stabs at Isshin after changing into his final <a href=\"/arrancar/4060-47805/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47805\"> Arrancar</a> release.</p><p>Fisher stares in disbelief as Isshin tells him that all captain level Soul Reapers can suppress their power so that their swords are small and not out outrageously large like Fisher's. Isshin looks at Kon and explains that he had fought Arrnacars before and then greets <a href=\"/kisuke-urahara/4005-43021/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43021\">Urahara Kisuke</a>. The two explain to each other that the Arrancars and the <a href=\"/vizards/4060-46640/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46640\">Vizards</a> are on the move to achieve their next goals, whatever that may be. Urahara reveals that Isshin has been in our world for twenty years and has lost most of his powers.</p><p>When Ichigo was engaged in a battle with <a href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\">Aizen Soskue</a>, Isshin interrupts the fight, stepping in between the two combatants and head butting his son off of the building so they could hide from Aizen and talk a little bit. After having a short discussion, they continue their battle with Aizen. <a href=\"/gin-ichimaru/4005-42858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42858\">Gin Ichimaru </a>promptly arrives and begins to battle Ichigo while Isshin takes on Aizen. With one flick of his finger, Isshin easily knocks Aizen away, hurling him through several buildings.</p><p>Later, as the prolonged combat continues and Isshin appears to have the advantage, he notices that Aizen is now having a harder time with him. He asks his opponent why his movements are slowing down, why he's breathing heavy and if he has reached his limit already. Aizen states that he has reached his limit as a shinigami, then begins to transform with the Hougyoku. At this point, Kisuke attacks Aizen from behind and takes over the fight. After this, Aizen fully transforms and says that he is invincible. This is when Isshin and Kisuke try to attack him head on but both get deflected, but it was a trap and they have chains connected to him and hold him down while <a href=\"/yoruichi-shihouin/4005-47126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47126\">Yoruichi </a>slams him into the ground, but appears to have no affect and Aizen states that he will kill them all. After that, Kisuke and Youruichi just fuss about how her armor broke, while Isshin stands in the background in disbelief, listening to the two argue. Later, after the three of them are overwhelmed by Aizen and utterly defeated, the latter leaves for Soul Society with Gin. Isshin and Ichigo follow them, but while traveling to Soul Society, Isshin decides to teach his son a powerful technique, the Final Getsuga Tensho.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894581\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6786885245902\" data-width=\"610\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894581\"><img alt=\"Shinigami Isshin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg 610w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg 571w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shinigami Isshin\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg 610w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43593/894581-isshin1.jpg 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" data-width=\"571\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shinigami Isshin</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263090\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4348785871965\" data-width=\"906\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 906px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1263090\"><img alt=\"Isshin sends Aizen flying\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg 906w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg 669w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Isshin sends Aizen flying\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg 906w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63278/1263090-18.jpg 669w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Isshin sends Aizen flying</figcaption></figure><p>Albeit brief, we first witness some of Isshin's powerful swordsmanship as he defeats a giant</p><p><a href=\"///\"> Grand Fisher</a></p><p>(and his extraordinarily large Zanpakutō) with one swing of his normal sized, unreleased Zanpakutō. Isshin has proven to be a very powerful, captain-level shinigami as displayed by his battle with Aizen.

This helped protect him against attacks from foes as powerful as an Arrancar.

    "deck": "Chuma was a priest and now is the assistant of Cheetah (Barbara Minerva).",
    "description": "<p>Chuma is a member of an unnamed pygmy tribe in West Africa. This tribe for generations was protected by a cat goddess. This goddess was at one time a mortal member of the tribe but upon being selected, underwent the transformation and became the tribe's protector. This continued for well over 300 years, but the goddess proved to be her own downfall. She was required to kill humans but as news of her powers reached the outside world few ventured to visit the tribe. Finally out of desperation Chuma, one of the head priests visited the civilized world and told leading archaeologists of the presence of this tribe and offering to lead them back. One such group met their gruesome murder at the hands of the cat goddess but the next one which followed was composed of a group of people who would be the undoing of the tribe. Two of the members were pretending to be porters only so that they could determine the location of the village without walking into a trap. Another member was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8344\" href=\"/cheetah/4005-8344/\" slug=\"cheetah\">Barbara Minerva</a>. Before the arrival of those intent on destroying the city, Barbara herself shot and killed the cat goddess. They became caught thereafter in a caved in building, and Chuma interpreted the will of the gods that Barbara was meant to become the next cat goddess. With the necessary preparations ready Chuma informed Barbara that she needed the blood of a kill in order to complete the process. Barbara chose her male colleague who had also been a member of the expedition. After killing him Barbara was ready to imbibe the potion and become the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8344\" href=\"/cheetah/4005-8344/\" slug=\"cheetah\">Cheetah</a>. She quickly killed the attacking villagers, but only after they had killed all of Chuma's tribe. With their deaths the only place left for Chuma was at Barbara's side as her assistant. Chuma had forgotten in his spell preparations that the cat goddess must be a virgin, and as a result Barbara began to become frail physically, though her Cheetah persona was unaffected. The two sought out various remedies for her condition, until Barbara postulated that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41435\" href=\"/lasso-of-truth/4055-41435/\" slug=\"lasso-of-truth\">lasso</a> might hold the power to heal her. The two made the acquisition of the lasso their goal, whch they were finally able to do following an attack on Wonder Woman by two <a data-ref-id=\"4060-18273\" href=\"/khunds/4060-18273/\" slug=\"khunds\">Khunds</a>.</p><p>Chuma is a frail old man with little ability beyond plotting and cunning. He has an extensive knowledge of various concoctions, including poisons.</p>",

    "description": "<p></p><h2>History</h2>Jonah McCarthy was an agent of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40521\" href=\"/checkmate/4060-40521/\" slug=\"checkmate\">Checkmate</a>. Under the cover of a Harvard educated lawyer, he was hired on as part of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a>'s staff at her Themysciran embassy. He played the part of a man outside of his element, often in awe of the likes of Wonder Woman and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a>. He and Wonder Woman developed a connection, possibly romantic, during his time working by her side.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764152-jonah4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764152\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.734\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764152-jonah4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764152\"><img alt=\"Bullfighting\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/764152-jonah4.png\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764152-jonah4.png 500w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/764152-jonah4.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Bullfighting</figcaption></figure>His cover remained solid until Wonder Woman recovered from the blindness she suffered from her battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17690\" href=\"/medusa/4005-17690/\" slug=\"medusa\">Medusa</a>. She had been given new sight by her patron goddess <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10912\" href=\"/athena/4005-10912/\" slug=\"athena\">Athena</a> that gave her new insights on those around her. When she saw Jonah again, she saw that there was something he had been hiding. Not only that, but he was even afraid of her. An emergency called her away before she could question him about his true motives for working for her, and she told <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58369\" href=\"/ferdinand/4005-58369/\" slug=\"ferdinand\">Ferdinand</a> to see to it that he remained at the embassy until she returned. Jonah, knowing his cover was about to be compromised, took this opportunity to leave. Ferdinand tried to stop him but was surprised and overcome by his sudden skill in hand-to-hand combat. He did nothing to harm Ferdinand and only rendered him unconscious.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\" href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" slug=\"maxwell-lord\">Maxwell Lord</a>'s death at Wonder Woman's hands happened almost immediately after this, and Jonah received the order that all Checkmate assets were being recalled. This was simple enough for him, since he was already on his way back with his cover blown. However, Wonder Woman managed to track him down and intercept his car as he was speeding down the road. She accused him of lying to her, but he countered by saying she just never asked. He told her it was not Maxwell Lord he worked for. It was Checkmate. He knew her well enough to know that if she killed Lord then Lord must have crossed a line that left her with no choice. Wonder Woman had to let him go, because as he said, she could not prove he had done anything more than speeding and she had enough trouble to deal with since she killed Lord.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764150-jonah2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764150\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.568\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764150-jonah2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764150\"><img alt=\"Black Queen's Knight no more\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/764150-jonah2.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/764150-jonah2.png 500w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35127/764150-jonah2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Black Queen's Knight no more</figcaption></figure>Jonah returned to Checkmate and stayed with the organization even after it was dismantled and rebuilt under the United Nations. A year after his confrontation with Wonder Woman, he was serving <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5552\" href=\"/sasha-bordeaux/4005-5552/\" slug=\"sasha-bordeaux\">Sasha Bordeaux</a> as the Black Queen's Knight. He exhibited a friendly and flirtatious relationship with her, despite her being taken by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19179\" href=\"/mr-terrific/4005-19179/\" slug=\"mr-terrific\">Mr. Terrific</a>. It was all simply in good humor. On a operation with Sasha and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4439\" href=\"/fire/4005-4439/\" slug=\"fire\">Fire</a>, they raided a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55793\" href=\"/kobra/4060-55793/\" slug=\"kobra\">Kobra</a> base off the Gulf of Aden. He was shot and killed as he and Sasha burst into a room to secure and the Kobra soldier got a shot off before Sasha could take him out. She turned to see that Jonah was dead.<br/>",

Cale worked hard to get to her position of power in “man’s world” but she resents <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman </a> for finding acceptance in a patriarchal society so easily. Dr. Cale also views Diana’s message for peace as simplistic reasoning which is easy to proclaim when someone like Diana is a super strong demi-goddess that can end her conflicts with a few hard hitting punches. However, Cale’s resentment toward Diana runs further than just petty envy. Cale's hatred of Wonder Woman seems to be founded on competition because she believes that if there is a Wonder Woman then it can only be her. Cale's tragic childhood also plays a factor in Cale’s way of thinking. Her father left before she was born, her mother died early of cancer but Cale was able to gain a number of doctorate degrees and became a self-made female millionaire as well as a philanthropist. Cale believes that her accomplishments should have made her more worthy of the people’s reverence than being born into fame and fortune like Diana was.</p><p>When Diana wrote <i>Reflections</i>, a study of Amazon philosophy, Dr. Cale sought to discredit Wonder Woman by using Diana's controversial new book. Dr. Cale uses selected quotations from the book to spin the media against Diana. Cale became the book's most outspoken critic and she loses the debate with Diana no less. Afterwards, Cale arranges to have the book's proponents killed at a demonstration which was being held in an embassy. By this time, Cale had allied herself with some of Wonder Woman’s deadliest foes like <a href=\"/dr-psycho/4005-4918/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4918\">Doctor Psycho</a>. Dr. Psycho used is manipulative skills to draw the crowds into an uproar thus creating a riot outside the embassy. Eventually, Dr. Psycho captures Cale by binding, gagging, and locking her in a closet. Dr. Psycho then took this opportunity to impersonate Dr. Cale but this only lasted for a short while. Dr. Psycho was defeated and Dr. Cale was rescued by none other than Wonder Woman. Unfortunately, this does not change Cale’s perception of Wonder Woman since Diana’s influence has touched Dr. Anderson which Cale finds infuriating.</p><p>Dr. Cale is later coerced by Circe into becoming the legal guardian of Circe's daughter <a href=\"/lyta/4005-17658/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17658\">Lyta</a> as a way of removing Lyta from Themyscira, the Amazon Island in exchange for Circe’s involvement in Cale’s revenge plot against Wonder Woman. Circe and Cale work together in upgrading<a href=\"/silver-swan/4005-10922/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10922\"> Silver Swan</a>’s (<a href=\"/vanessa-kapatelis/4005-15791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15791\">Vanessa Kapatelis</a>) weaponry after purchasing Swan from <a href=\"/sebastian-ballesteros/4005-17677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17677\">Sebastian Ballesteros</a>. Dr. Cale also helped <a href=\"/circe/4005-10924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10924\">Circe</a> with resurrecting <a href=\"/medusa/4005-55618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55618\">Medusa</a> in order to unleash the gorgon on \"man's world.\" However, this arrangement between these two witches is dissolved when <a href=\"/ares/4005-70037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70037\">Ares</a> arrives and kidnaps Lyta from the island which angers Circe. Circe abandons Cale’s scheme until Cale manages to return Lyta to her mother with Wonder Woman’s help.</p><p>When Wonder Woman killed <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Maxwell Lord </a>for murdering <a href=\"/ted-kord/4005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\">Ted Kord</a>, Dr. Cale was momentarily satisfied by the media’s scrutiny towards the Amazon Princess until she was kidnapped by Chang Tzu aka Egg Fu. During Week 26 of 52, Dr. Cale appears alongside other abducted scientists on Oolong Island. She was the only female among the unscrupulous group of mad scientists. Eventually, Cale suffers from a mental breakdown after releasing Egg Fu’s pet project from Apokolips: the Four Horsemen. Sobek, who represented the Famine Horseman, devoured Osiris while the other Horsemen defeated the Black Marvel family. In retaliation, Black Adam starts his world-wide crusade for vengeance starting with Oolong Island.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cale’s mental breakdown causes her feelings to conflict with one another. Will Magnus was the only creditable doctor amongst the other scientists. Magnus’ handsome demeanor drove Cale to seducing Magnus and eventually fall in love with him. When Black Adam arrived on Oolong Island, Adam threatened to kill Magnus first for creating the Horsemen but Cale proclaims that she is to blame. Her attempt to confess and confront Shazam’s fallen hero was ignored as Adam continued to destroy the island. Cale managed to help Magnus as well as the other mad scientists get off the island. Magnus left Cale and Cale formed an independent collective with the remaining scientists called the Science Squad.</p><p>The collective’s first problem was the return of the Four Horsemen of Apokilips. Feeling responsible, Cale ingests a semi-organic containment unit and uses it to absorb the Horsemen's essence. She later undergoes an operation to remove the unit thereby sending the Horsemen back to Apokolips. Cale then becomes the President of Oolong Island after she had attained sovereignty. With Ira Quimby by her side, Cale also becomes a reluctant ally with the Doom Patrol because she needed the Doom Patrol as the island's pre-emptive strike force in case of an emergency.</p><p>Eventually, Cale betrays the Doom Patrol when she joins forces with the Front Men who used to work for Thayer Jost when he was possessed by Mr. Somebody.</p>",

    "description": "<h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>Hot Shot was first seen in the Japanese Robots in Disguise Cartoon. He was originally going to be named Ricochet but was later changed to be his Targetmaster partner Artfire. In an early <i>Armada</i> series bible, Hot Shot was originally going to be <a href=\"/bumblebee/4005-30511/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30511\">Bumblebee</a>. The reason he was ultimately not named Bumblebee was because the name was unavailable as a trademark for Hasbro. In Transformers Animated, Hot Shot was to take the place of Bumblebee, but because Hasbro had Bumblebee trademarked for the <a href=\"/transformers/4025-65/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-65\">2007 Film</a>, he became a separate character in Season 3. Hot Shot was later used in the Prime universe, he identified by Hasbro artist <a href=\"/marcelo-matere/4040-55764/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55764\">Marcelo Matere</a> as <a href=\"/rodimus-prime/4005-41691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41691\">Rodimus</a>. According to Aaron Archer, the character was named Hot Shot due to Hot Rod being an unprotectable name. Hasbro later revealed that they wanted fans to see how Hot Shot became Rodimus.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h4>Transformers: Armada</h4><p>Hot Shot is a member of <a href=\"/optimus-prime/4005-6467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6467\">Optimus Prime</a>'s team, Hot Shot evolved to Powerlinx Hot Shot on the his way to <a href=\"/cybertron/4020-41978/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41978\">Cybertron</a> when Optimus Prime was injured. Once Hot Shot and Wheel Jack was friends but after Wheel Jacks injuries against the War, Hot Shot left making Wheel Jack think he had betryed him. Hot Shot traveled to Earth to find the Mini-Cons. What Hot Shot didnt know is that Wheel Jack arrived on Earth, They then battled with rage and anger. Hot Shot survived as one of the autobots helped.</p><h4>Transformers: Energon</h4><p>Ten years after the end of Armada, Hot Shot matured and became an officer in the inner circle. Still a yellow sports car. He was then transformed into a red and yellow aston martin. After having an upgrade he was given the privelage to combine mini-cons to his body.</p><p>Hot Shot had various battles surrounding <a href=\"/unicron/4005-40496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40496\">Unicron</a>, battling both <a href=\"/decepticons/4060-40490/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40490\">Decepticon</a>s and <a href=\"/terrorcons/4060-42025/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42025\">Terrorcon</a>s multiple times, once again being reformatted after being nearly destroyed in an attack by Unicron. He also spent much time mentoring Ironhide into a more responsible and mature Autobot. He eventually combined his Spark with those of all other Autobots to empower Optimus Supreme to battle a Unicron possessed <a href=\"/galvatron/4005-41902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41902\">Galvatron</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Rob Fortune, aka Cowboy (a nickname from Ryder, which he's not particularly fond of) was a surfer dude in LA. He was out surfing when he wiped out, and then found he could somehow grow gills and breathe underwater. His girlfriend, Tobi Frye, was actually \"one 'a them stinkin' Skrulls\". Ryder blew her away and exposed her true nature, then chased Rob down and wrecked his car. Ryder revealed the cause of his own recent changes to Rob, and he joined the group.</p><p>Rob has many reservations about actually killing anything, even Skrulls.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Rob can transform his hands/arms into different objects/weapons. He could transform into representations of other objects. Rob eventually gains some sort of control over his personal reality, able to phase in and out of any place and back at will. He claims he gained this ability after the Skrull DNA finally overcame the remainder of his human DNA, thus changing reality itself.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br/></h2>\"Heidi Slatkin, a.k.a. Riot, a punk rock riot grrl from the U.K. A cute redhead with a short buzz cut, Riot transformed into a massive, beastly creature with sharp teeth, massive tusks and an insectoid carapace.\" <br/><br/>In this form she has great strength and sharp spines. She was stuck in that form for an extended period of time. During the tail-end of the Secret Invasion, Riot altered herself back to her human form, succumbing to the fatal transition and passing away... with dignity as a human. It is later revealed that she survived working with Ryder grudgingly. Riot's also looking on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Match.com</a> for a lesbian dating partner, though she has trouble reverting back to her human form again.  <br/> <br/>Eventually she learns to control her transformation from insectoid to human form. She meets a Skrull named Eva and seems to fall in love with her, repeatedly defending her against the other members of the Krew. Eva eventually becomes an inactive part of the Krew, riding with Heidi. <br/> <br/><h2>Powers<br/></h2>Able to transform at will into an insect-like creature with a hard carapace and sharp spines, tusks and claws. This form makes her very resilient to standard attacks.

    "description": "<p>Ryder along with a handful of people ate some beef that was contaminated. It seams some years back <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\" href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" slug=\"mr-fantastic\">Reed Richards</a> brainwashed some <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\" href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" slug=\"skrulls\">Skrulls</a> into believing that they were cows. He gained shapeshifting and teleportation abilities. Ryder lead a band of people with similar powers on a crusade to hunt and kill all Skrulls that are on earth. They are known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42982\" href=\"/skrull-kill-krew/4060-42982/\" slug=\"skrull-kill-krew\">Skrull Kill Krew</a>, and all are slowly dying from from eating the Skrull meat.</p><p>About the time the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\" href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" slug=\"secret-invasion\">Secret Invasion</a> happened, he and Riot are all that is left. Then they stumbled upon Delroy Garrett, the new <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43653\" href=\"/3-d-man/4005-43653/\" slug=\"3-d-man\">3-D Man</a>. After the Secret Invasion ended, Ryder and Delroy are the only ones left, and continue to hunt down Skrulls here on earth. Ryder prefers to use a lot of big guns to get the job done, and eventually simply transforms his arms/hands into large guns (the specifics of the projectile functions has yet to be explained).</p><p>Ryder eventually resurrects <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43638\" href=\"/catwalk/4005-43638/\" slug=\"catwalk\">Catwalk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43640\" href=\"/dice/4005-43640/\" slug=\"dice\">Dice</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43641\" href=\"/moonstomp/4005-43641/\" slug=\"moonstomp\">Moonstomp</a>, essentially recreating the Skrull Kill Krew. He blows off 3-D Man shortly after the Invasion and goes on a new Skrull killing spree with the original Krew. After a short escapade of Skrull massacres, Ryder and Krew become aware of Native-born Skrulls' that apparently took no part in the Secret Invasion. They take a soft-side toward these Natives (save for Moonstomp, whom Ryder blasts to bits) and end up defending them against Norman Osborn, threatening his life if any more Native-born Skrulls end up disappearing. This is on the cusp of the revelation that Ryder and Krew's DNA has been completely overtaken by the Skrull DNA in their systems... essentially making them Skrulls.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Due to the infusion of Skrull DNA he has advanced shape shifting abilities, allowing him to turn his limbs into working guns, turn his body into asbestos to resist flame, turn invisible and heal from normally fatal injuries. Like the rest of the Kill Krew, he can see through skrulls' disguises though Ryder has also demonstrated the ability to see invisible opponents. Ryder is a skilled combatant with reflexes good enough to snatch <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America'</a>s shield out of the air. He also demonstrated both telepathy and teleportation.</p>",

    "description": "<h3>History<br/></h3><p>Born during the early years of the 1900's he was subjected to a procedure  first pioneered by a Nazi vampire named <a href=\"///\">      Baron Blood</a>.  It afforded him the ability to withstand the rays of the sun. <br/> <br/>After the war he moved across the world amassing a small fortune and later settled at an exclusive boarding school for girls nestled in the swiss alps. Here him and his coven, himself and his secretary, fed on the boarding school students and some they even turned into vampires like themselves.  <br/> <br/>Everything was perfect and no one questioned the strange random deaths that occurred there. That is until mutant student Monet St.croix arrived.<br/><br/></p><h3>The End</h3><p>Mister DeLacourte first came to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\" href=\"/m/4005-40460/\" slug=\"m\">      M</a>'s attention when her classmate Tabby (Tabitha Gance) was killed, mysteriously found with two small puncture marks in her neck. he tried to fool the student body into believing it was just a normal death but M was not convinced. <br/> <br/>To put an end to the troublemaker DeLacourte invited Monet to his office late one night so he could feast on her. He tried to use hypnosis on her but her powers of telepathy counteracted this. He did however succeed in biting her  though her strength was more than a match for his own.  <br/> <br/>He was then forced to avoid the polices questions and he revealed his immunity to sunlight to Monet.  That night he tried to feed on another student and him and Monet engaged in battle. She manged to stake not just him but also his secretary. Thus putting an end to his reign.<br/> <br/></p><h3> Powers </h3><p><br/>All the conventional powers possessed by Vampires as well as complete immunity to the effects of sunlight.<br/></p><p><br/></p>",

During the 1950's, NASA was just starting to put their first men into orbit. The key to the success of the space program was the XF-13 rocket plane, an experimental aircraft capable of reaching the uppermost atmosphere. When it was time to test this craft, one of the first men chosen to fly it was Charles \"Chuck\" Chandler. On Chucks very first test flight of the XF-13 aircraft, he was tailed and later abducted by the alien Skrulls. The Skrulls had been observing planet Earth for ages in the hope of using it's strategic position to gain the advantage in their long-standing war with the alien Kree. So with that in mind, the Skrulls became interested in earth's space exploration programs. The night before Chuck was to make his first test flight of the XF-13, the Skrulls orchestrated a failed kidnapping attempt in which Chuck's brother Hal helped him to escape. The Skrulls wanted to abduct test pilots so that they could gain vital information regarding the space program in which they operated in.</p><p>Coming to the realization that Chuck would never willingly give up any information, the Skrulls prepared to use a mind probe ray on him. In that instant he broke free of the Skrulls grasp and escaped. During his desperate efforts to escape, he damaged several components of the ships warp drive which were necessary for it's continued safe operation. Just as he was attempting to make his dramatic escape in the XF-13, the Skrull ship exploded due to an overload in the power core caused by all the damage he had done. Hal made his escape unharmed, but was exposed to the alien radiation that was released due to the ship's explosion. The XF-13 was badly damaged in the escape so Chuck decided to land the ship in the Mojave Desert where he knew his brother Hal would be watching the test flights. When Chuck ejected from the XF-13, his brother ran over to greet him but just as he drew near, Chuck vanished in a burst of light.</p><p>In the belief that his brother had perished, Hal returned to Los Angeles to inform their parents, and the NASA authorities. That night Hal noticed that there was an image of a man imprinted into the lens of his pair of glasses, and that one lens was red and the other green. Hal figured out that the images on the lenses of his glasses belonged to none other than that of his brother Chuck, and that they were imprinted there when he vanished in that burst of light. By putting on the pair of glasses and concentrating on the two images while focusing on a flat surface, Hal triggered a dimensional transfer that returned Chuck to this reality but left Hal in a trance-like state.</p><p>The radiation exposure from the explosion of the alien Skrull ship had altered Chuck. While still apparently human, the radiation had bonded his space suit to his body or more accurately.....the suit was his body. His new body was colored and mismatched into shades of red and green on two halves of him. He also discovered that his physical abilities had been tripled as a result of his new transformation. The last thing he discovered about his new found abilities was that he was very sensitive to the presence of Skrulls, no matter what shape they shifted into. When the Skrulls attempted to invade the United States, Chuck's powers came in very handy by being able to detect them while in human or any other form, which ultimately thwarted their plot to take over the planet. Although he had foiled many of the Skrulls attempts to take over the planet, alot of his time was spent in another dimension because he could only remain on earth for 3 hours at a time. When Chuck would return to the 2-D dimension of the glasses, Hal could then regain control of his body and emerge from his trance.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>3-D Man was created by Roy Thomas and Jim Craig and first appeared in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-premiere-35-the-3-d-man/4000-17354/\">Marvel Premiere Vol.1 issue 35</a> (1977).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Early Adventures</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687613\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687613-3d_man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0553633217993\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687613-3d_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687613\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687613-3d_man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687613-3d_man.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></a></figure><p>One night the Skrulls followed Hal home in hopes of destroying the 3-D Man. They blasted him with an energy beam that ultimately destroyed the Chuck persona locked within his glasses. Thus the hero named 3-D Man was lost for ever. Soon afterwards Hal became involved romantically with Chuck's girlfriend, Peggy Clark, which caused Hal to abandon the glasses, seeing the 3-D Man as a threat to his relationship. Later when Hal became threatened by the presence of the Hulk, he needed the glasses again. Somehow on this next transfer, Chuck was somehow still there! In no way could Chuck take on the Hulk in a physical altercation but he did indeed convince him to leave.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>During Secret Invasion, Chuck and Hal were seen telling their story to the new 3-D Man Triathlon.They are apparently retired from being Super Heroes so it's fitting their legacy would be carried on by another.</p><h3>Triathlon\\Delroy Garrett Jr.</h3><p>Delroy Garrett Jr., formally know as <a href=\"/triathlon/4005-3322/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3322\"> Triathlon</a> gained access to the 3-D Man goggles at his graduation from the Initiative, making him the new 3-D Man.</p><p> </p><h2>Commentary</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325563\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.08\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325563\"><img alt=\"3-D Man in Action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"3-D Man in Action\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6732/325563-41460-3-d-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" data-width=\"592\"></noscript></a><figcaption>3-D Man in Action</figcaption></figure><p>In an alternate reality, F.B.I. agent <a href=\"/jimmy-woo/4005-7530/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7530\"> Jimmy Woo</a> recruited the 3-D Man and several other heroes of the 1950s (<a href=\"/robert-grayson/4005-2153/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2153\"> Marvel Boy</a>, the <a href=\"/human-robot/4005-7245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7245\"> Human Robot</a>, <a href=\"/gorilla-man/4005-13960/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13960\"> Gorilla-Man</a> and <a href=\"/venus/4005-12632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12632\"> Venus</a>) to fight the agents of the <a href=\"/yellow-claw/4005-14525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14525\"> Yellow Claw</a> as the Avengers.

He dropped out of college after this, disheartened and unable to afford his course. After this, he joined the <a href=\"/united-states-marine-corps/4060-44416/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44416\">Marine Corps</a>, serving a tour of duty. He returned home, and went back to college education, attending night classes. He met a woman called Claire Smith and they became engaged. He became a vigilante after his fiance was murdered by the mafia. She did not tell him her real surname was Carmonti, and that she was the daughter of a recently slain mob boss. He would continue to run his auto garage to support himself, but at night he would pursue and kill criminals. He would go on to fight and kill domestic terrorists, urban criminals and mafia. He wears an old football jersey with a symbol of a laughing dog on it as his colors.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Wild Dog first appeared in his own <a href=\"/mini-series/4015-56281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56281\">mini-series</a> <a href=\"/wild-dog/4050-3823/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3823\"><em>Wild Dog</em></a> dated September 1987, from writer Max Allan Collins and the art team of Terry Beatty and Dick Giordano.</p><p>According to Terry Beatty, initial rejected names were \"Machine\", \"Commando\", \"Mad Dog\" and finally \"Red Dog\" which was only changed due to existence of a <em>G.I. Joe</em> action figure of the same name.</p><p>He was most likely an attempt to capture some of the success that was had by <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel</a>'s <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">The Punisher</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p>In the alternate timeline created when <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> saved <a href=\"/ted-kord/4005-2054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2054\">Ted Kord</a> from being shot, Wild Dog is one of the heroes recruited by <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Green Arrow</a> and <a href=\"/hawkman/4005-8337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8337\">Hawkman</a> to stop <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Maxwell Lord</a>. He is killed when Maxwell Lord uses his mind control powers to make Wild Dog shoot <a href=\"/pantha/4005-3585/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3585\">Pantha</a> and then himself.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Wild Dog is a superb athlete and is highly skilled at hand to hand combat.

Gage is a 17-year-old Eastbridge, Texas high school football star who led his division in tackles for the entire season, and is the darling of both his female schoolmates and college scouts. It was right after Gage was practicing on the football field that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\">Maddie Warner</a> introduced herself. She informed him that he was the biological son of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\">Captain Dynamo</a>. Through some coercion, Maddie was able to convince Gage to meet up with four other siblings in the similar predicament. They all met for the first time in the secret base of Captain Dynamo, located in Tower City. It was during this meeting that Maddie irradiated them all, unlocking their super powers. Maddie explained that Tower City needed heroes now that Captain Dynamo had died. The five sibling banded together as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\">Dynamo 5</a>.</p><p>He is a popular, arrogant jock who never gave a damn about what anyone thought - until he can literally hear those thoughts. And he may not like what he hears. Scatterbrain’s name may also be a reference to his obtuseness or absentmindedness, as he made a pass at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/scrap/4005-43664/\">Scrap</a> during their first meeting, requiring her to remind him that they were half-siblings. Gathering all five of the children together, Warner exposed them to the same unidentified radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his powers forty years earlier, unlocking their powers. Gage inherited his father’s telepathy. Gage takes the codename Scatterbrain, and works to protect Tower City with his newly discovered brothers and sisters.</p><p>Scatterbrain is often instrumental in the team's confrontations with its adversaries. One month after gaining his abilities, Scatterbrain and his siblings fought the paramilitary organization known as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45540\" href=\"/veil/4060-45540/\">The Veil</a>. Although he and the team acquitted themselves well against that foe, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\">Visionary</a> was kidnapped during the fracas, and brought to The Veil’s base. It fell upon Scatterbrain to use his telepathy to track Visionary via his brainwave pattern, which led to Visionary’s rescue. Scatterbrain was subsequently crucial to the team's victories against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46195\" href=\"/voltage/4005-46195/\">Voltage</a> and a thief using the Jessup-Poole Strong-Suit.</p><p>Despite his telepathy's usefulness, however, Gage has laments the adverse side-effects that his powers and his involvement in the team has had on his life. His inability to fully control his telepathy, his tendency to pick up the thoughts of others that he finds hurtful, and the manner in which new aspects of it may suddenly evolve unexpectedly, have been a source of irritation to him, often causing him to long for a more empowering ability like his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\">Olivia</a>'s flight. The difficulty in finding time for both his high school career and his superheroics leads to some sleeplessness, and tension between him and Maddie Warner. Gage also comes to blows with his brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\">Spencer</a> over him engaging in a romantic embrace with a schoolmate of Gage's while Spencer was impersonating Gage when Gage was in a coma. Spencer was given this mission by Maddie Warner in order to quell suspicion on the part of Gage's family, who are unaware of his life as a superhero, but Gage saw this act as an invasion of privacy on Spencer's part, though Spencer wonders if it is motivated by racism because the girl in question was black. Spencer apologizes to Gage, and confesses that, having grown up in foster homes, and having never had a real family or popularity in school, his experience with Gage's family opened his eyes to what he had missed all his life, and got carried away. Sympathetic to Spencer's feelings, Gage forgave him. Gage has learned that his brother, Visionary, was a virgin and has made it his mission to change that.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1038132-ramjet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1038132\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.006711409396\" data-width=\"298\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 298px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1038132-ramjet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1038132\"><img alt=\"Gage as Ramjet\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1038132-ramjet.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1038132-ramjet.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" data-width=\"298\"></a><figcaption>Gage as Ramjet</figcaption></figure><p>Gage was under a lot of pressure during his time on the football field due to not pulling his weight (because of his heroic alter ego) and to \"step up his game\" began using his telepathy to read the minds of the opposing players to know what was about to happen. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\">Hector</a>, who came to watch a game, scolded him on this as he considered it an unfair advantage.</p><p>One of Gage's younger (half) brothers have noticed the differences between their father and their oldest sibling and believes that Gage is adopted, a sentiment that Gage telepathically overheard. This was very difficult as he does not know if his mother cheated on the only father he has ever known, or if Captain Dynamo shape shifted into his father's form. After several adventures with his new family the group were attacked by their deranged half sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\">Synergy</a>. She used a weapon to remove their powers only to have the them later restored (or so they thought). A second burst of the radiation that gave them superpowers this time gave Gage the power of flight. He initially had difficulty mastering this ability until he received a new costume. He now goes by the name Ramjet.</p><p>At Christmas time Gage and his super siblings are tasked by Mattie to track down escaped felon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75004\" href=\"/luminex/4005-75004/\">Luminex</a>. Hector, Spencer and Gage arrive at a supervillain dive and after one of the crooks gets in Hector's face the young man starts a bar fight. During the fight Gage comes face to face with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61287\" href=\"/war-chest/4005-61287/\">Warchest</a>. Gage comments that this is the third time the pair have run into one another since the Alien Attack. It is revealed that every time since the attack the two have been in a sexual relationship. After coming up empty at the bar the super siblings find Luminex's daughter and begin to question her. The young woman freaks out and reveals that she has her father's powers and has taken the codename Lumina. Luminex arrives and during the fight Lumina threatens to kill Spencer but her father talks her out of it. Hector then helps convince <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75005\" href=\"/lumina/4005-75005/\">Lumina</a> that just because she can get revenge on the girls tormenting her at school doesn't mean it's right to do so. The Dynamo 5 let Lumina go, return a willing Luminex to prison and then proceed to have Christmas. Gage is shown having Christmas with his mother, father and half-brothers.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Scatterbrain is a telepath who can read other people’s minds. His power is both voluntary and passive; While he can use his power to deliberately read someone's mind, he can also involuntarily pick up the thoughts of those around him, even when he does not wish it. He can also use his telepathy to remotely track people whose minds he has read, by sifting through the brainwave patterns he can sense, which are apparently unique to each individual. After initially gaining his powers, he could not use his telepathy as an offensive weapon, or control other people's thoughts and actions, as other comic book telepaths can. However, when Scatterbrain was attacked and electrocuted by Voltage, a villain who can wield electrical energy, this triggered an ability on Scatterbrain's part to cease Voltage's electrical attack by merely thinking about it, and rendered Voltage unconscious. It also briefly knocked Scatterbrain into semi-consciousness. Scatterbrain also has the ability to completely wipe out a person's memories, giving them total amnesia, as he did with his half-sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\">Synergy</a>, though this act left him in a coma for a day or two <u>.</u> During this coma, Scatterbrain discovered that he is also capable of astral projection, and was able to instantly transport his astral self to familiar locations by merely willing it. He appeared at his high school, where he was attacked the villainess <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49624\" href=\"/brains/4005-49624/\">Brains</a>, another telepath. Brains claimed that that location was \"her space\" and \"her private place\", and engaged Scatterbrain in what appeared to be a physical altercation between their astral forms, but when Scatterbrain responded in kind, he inadvertently transported them to a featureless white location that he speculated was \"his place\", and was able to manifest his abilities according to his own imagination, multiplying his form several times, and attacking Brains en masse, forcing her to flee the astral plane, and bringing him out of his coma. His telepathy makes him immune to the illusions created by the villain Doctor Chimera. It can also enable him to affect technology that is keyed to a specific person's brainwaves, as when he disabled the Jessup-Poole Strong-Suit utilized by a thief who stole it from the Winterbourne institute, which was keyed to that thief's brainwaves. The suit was later modified to prevent Scatterbrain from doing this.</p><p>There are some limits on Scatterbrain's telepathy. He cannot read someone’s mind if they are unconscious, though he was able to enter Maddie Warner's mind when she was in a coma in order to communicate with her consciousness and pull her out of that state. When Scatterbrain attempted to telepathically probe the mind of the psychotic Lipinski (aka Slaughterhouse), the experience was so emotionally traumatic for Scatterbrain that it briefly incapacitated him in the heat of battle. The government superhuman-monitoring agency <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45541\" href=\"/flag/4060-45541/\">F.L.A.G.</a> has a manual and a course it requires for its agents who interrogate telepaths like Scatterbrain, in order to prevent the compromise of sensitive information, but its exact protocols are unknown. Scatterbrain’s telepathy operates within a certain reception radius, but that radius has not been specified.</p><p>Scatterbrain also uses his skills as a football player when fighting foes, usually tackling an enemy.</p><p>After having lost his powers of telepathy, Gage has gained the ability to fly. Whereas his sister Olivia wore a wingsuit outfit to aid her maneuverability, Gage's natural aptitude at maneuvering makes this unnecessary. However, his ability to effect sudden stops and land properly is far lower than hers, and thus he wears an armored suit that not only protects him from impact, but enables him to act as a human battering ram, from which his current codename is derived. The armor was built by a friend of Maddie Waner, he indicated to Gage that the armor was strong enought, that it could allow him to smash right through a building.</p>",

Jennifer never knew that the man was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">Captain Dynamo</a>, and never saw him again. She raised Hector as a single parent, and although Hector's maternal grandfather has also been a positive presence in his life, Jennifer has lamented the lack of a male role model in Hector's life, as Hector tends to think of his father when Father's Day approaches.</p><p>Following the assassination of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">Captain Dynamo</a>, the much-beloved superhero protector of Tower City, his widow, former government agent posing as a now-retired investigative reporter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">Maddie Warner</a>, discovers from his personal effects that he had been unfaithful to her countless times over the years. Despite her devastation at this discovery, Warner realized that without a full-time protector, Tower City would be vulnerable to Captain Dynamo’s legion of super-villain enemies. She used her skills and the information she discovered to track down five candidates that could be Dynamo’s illegitimate children, thus her step children.</p><p>The first of Captain Dynamo’s children Warner contacts is 15-year-old Hector Chang, a Vancouver, British Columbia high school geek who bullied at school. When Warner appears before him offering to change his life, Hector is initially skeptical, stating that he had heard such things before from guidance counselors, but still accepts the invitation. Gathering all five of the children together, Warner exposes them to the same unidentified radiation that gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">Captain Dynamo</a> his powers forty years earlier, unlocking their powers. Hector, the youngest of the Dynamo 5 siblings,inherits his father’s vision-related powers. He takes the codename Visionary, and works to protect Tower City with his newly discovered brothers and sisters. The team learns later that they have another half sibling in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a>, the daughter of their father's arch enemy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45539\" href=\"/chrysalis/4005-45539/\" slug=\"chrysalis\">Chrysalis</a>. Working as a team they manage to defeat their sister (who has all of their powers) and her mother.</p><p>One month after gaining his abilities, Visionary and his siblings fought the paramilitary organization known as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45540\" href=\"/veil/4060-45540/\" slug=\"veil\">The Veil</a>. Although he and the team acquitted themselves well against the Veil, Visionary himself was kidnapped during the fracas, and brought to The Veil’s base, where he was injected with a serum to make him amenable to interrogation by The Veil’s leader, who called himself The Superior. Visionary divulged everything about himself and his siblings, how they inherited their powers, and how Warner assembled them, but before The Veil could make use of this information, Visionary was rescued by Warner and the rest of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">Dynamo 5</a>, who had tracked him using <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\">Scatterbrain</a>'s telepathy. His powers have also proven useful in reconnaissance, as when the team investigated the reappearance of the creature known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46188\" href=\"/whiptail/4005-46188/\" slug=\"whiptail\">Whiptail</a>, and as a weapon against adversaries such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46191\" href=\"/quake/4005-46191/\" slug=\"quake\">Quake</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/721821-visionary.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-721821\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6818181818182\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/721821-visionary.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-721821\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/721821-visionary.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/721821-visionary.jpg 352w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px\" data-width=\"352\"></a></figure><p>Despite never having known his father, he thinks of Captain Dynamo as \"Dad\", and a poster of Dynamo hangs over his bed.This is in contrast to his siblings, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/scrap/4005-43664/\" slug=\"scrap\">Bridget</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\">Gage</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\">Olivia</a>, who were raised by adoptive fathers, or his brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\">Spencer</a>, who, having wondered all his life who his father was, only to be disappointed to learn it was Captain Dynamo, thinks of the late superhero as \"an enormous hypocrite and a horrible husband\". After gaining his powers, Hector exhibits greater confidence in the face of bullies at school, but his social awkwardness and virginity is been a source of embarrassment, in light of his siblings' greater range of experience. Although <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\">Gage</a> and Spencer place great importance on this, his sisters Bridget and Olivia are more understanding.</p><p>Hector's life as a costumed superhero creates difficulties for his home life, particularly when his capture, along with the rest of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">Dynamo 5</a>, by the U.S. government superhero-monitoring organization known as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45541\" href=\"/flag/4060-45541/\" slug=\"flag\">F.L.A.G</a>., keeps him away from home for two days, causing his mother to panic. She eventually discovers Hector's secret accidentally when she walks in on him as he attempts to use the teleportational device known as a Jump Portal, which the team uses to assemble for missions. Hector reveals the truth to her about Captain Dynamo, his siblings, and his superhero life. Jennifer is angered at learning that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">Maddie Warner</a> exposed Hector to a heavy dose of radiation to unlock his powers, and after having Hector introduce them, she threatens to report Warner to the authorities for what she regarded as child endangerment and possibly kidnapping. Warner insists that because his children share Captain Dynamo's DNA, the radiation poses no risk to the children, and speculates that Jennifer's ire was motivated more from feeling abandoned by the man who seduced her, but Jennifer is not amused by this statement. Before this conflict could be resolved, Warner and Jennifer are taken hostage by the assassin, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52209\" href=\"/widowmaker/4005-52209/\" slug=\"widowmaker\">Widowmaker</a>. In order to save her son's life, Jennifer tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52209\" href=\"/widowmaker/4005-52209/\" slug=\"widowmaker\">Widowmaker</a> about the Jump Station, which Hector later sees as an act of betrayal on her part. Despite the fact that Jennifer forbids Hector to continue his superheroics, he does so anyway.</p><p>Hector goes to support <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\">Gage</a> at one of his football games but becomes angry with his brother when he realized that Gage is using his telepathy to read his opponents minds to win the game.</p><p>After meeting the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56280\" href=\"/firebirds/4060-56280/\" slug=\"firebirds\">Firebirds</a> Hector becomes enamored with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60199\" href=\"/emily-reed/4005-60199/\" slug=\"emily-reed\">Emily Reed</a>, the younger of the duo (the older, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5213\" href=\"/rebecca-reed/4005-5213/\" slug=\"rebecca-reed\">Rebecca Reed</a>, being her mother). While the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">Dynamo 5</a> separate due to personal issues involving Myriad, Hector answers the call when the temporary Dynamo 5 need help. Hector visits Rebecca in the hospital and even brings her flowers, which scores brownie points with the enamored Emily Reed. Emily and Hector go on a date (initially bored with then mundane version) and then to the D5 training room for some fun. Their date ends in a kiss.</p><p>When Hector's half sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a> faces off against them again she managed to remove their powers.

When the treat posed by Synergy and her benifactor are removed Hector returns to his life but plans some payback on the school bully.

Emily comforts him. When Hector answers Maddie's emergency call, Emily changes into Firebird costume and insists to go with him, reminding Hector that she is honorary member of Dynamo 5. During the battle Hector openly expresses interest in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17905\" href=\"/angel-murphy/4005-17905/\" slug=\"angel-murphy\">Angel Murphy</a>, making Emily jealous. After Firebird was gravely injured, Hector teleported to Winterborne Institute and acquired the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62897\" href=\"/strong-suit/4005-62897/\" slug=\"strong-suit\">Strong-Suit</a>. With his strength increased significantly by the suit, Hector was able to defeat the Sons of Dominex, killing them, including the last one who tried to surrender. After the battle he wants to go to the hospital to see Emily, but Bridget stopped him. expressing her concern for her teammate's disregard of human life. Hector replies callously, \"They were't people, they were aliens\", not noticing the hurt look on Spencer's face. Bridget asks him to take off the Strong-Suit, Hector denies that the suit can corrupt him and removes it. He rushes to the hospital to see Emily, who is still unconscious. Rebecca confronts Hector, asking what happened to her daughter, and slaps him when she learns about Dominex. Later, during the meeting of Dynamo 5 at The Aquarium, Hector tells them that he regrets what he did and asks to forgive him. But Spencer read Hector's mind and found out that his remorse wasn't sincere.</p><h3><strong>Aftermath</strong></h3><p>Hector has apparently returned to his normal self, a fact that worries his brother Spencer. The Dynamo 5 are tasked by Mattie to track down escaped felon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75004\" href=\"/luminex/4005-75004/\" slug=\"luminex\">Luminex</a>. Hector, Spencer and Gage arrive at a supervillain dive and after one of the crooks gets in Hector's face the young man starts a bar fight. After coming up empty at the bar the super siblings find Luminex's daughter and begin to question her. The young woman freaks out and reveals that she has her father's powers and has taken the codename <a data-ref-id=\"4005-75005\" href=\"/lumina/4005-75005/\" slug=\"lumina\">Lumina</a>. Luminex arrives and during the fight Lumina threatens to kill Spencer but her father talks her out of it. Hector then helps convince Lumina that just because she can get revenge on the girls tormenting her at school doesn't mean it's right to do so. The Dynamo 5 let Lumina go, return a willing Luminex to prison and then proceed to have Christmas. Hector and his mother have Christmas with Olivia, her father and Mattie.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Hector Chang is the son of Captain Dynamo and upon being exposed to radiation gained super powers. Originally going by Visionary he had Supervision but after a losing those powers he was exposed to a second dose of radiation, gaining superhuman strength and invulnerability , but his levels are not yet known, his durability is still low level as a bully's punch still winded him, but for the most part his powers appear to function exactly as they did when his sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/supervision/4005-43664/\" slug=\"supervision\">Scrap</a>, possessed them. Although Smasher has not been observed using these powers for long, when his sister employed them, she could lift tanks over her head, throw them the length of a city block, and destroy large powered armor suits by kicking them, without sustaining any injury. She could also shrug off automatic weapons fire, and on one occasion, fell off a skyscraper, was smashed through the street below, and endured further kicks to the abdomen by the superhumanly strong villain Synergy, without more than a moment's incapacitation. On the other hand, electricity of a sufficient power level could temporarily stun her, and a direct punch from the supervillain Brawn was able to knock her into unconsciousness or semi-consciousness for several moments.</p><p>He now has Superhuman Strength and Durability</p><p>As Visionary Hector had the superhuman abilities related to his eyesight, which include laser vision, X-ray vision, and telescopic vision. His laser vision is used as an offensive weapon, and can be used to neutralize human opponents, and large objects such as armored tanks, though unlike his father’s laser blasts, Visionary’s are yellow instead of red. His x-ray vision allows him to see through solid objects. His telescopic vision allows him to see great distances.The upper limits of each of these powers is not yet been revealed. The helmet Visionary wears includes a visor that focuses his laster blasts, making them more concentrated. This advantage served to nearly defeat his half-sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a> in when the two of them engaged each other in a laser vision standoff in <i>Dynamo 5</i> #7, as she lacked such a device, though she was saved by the intervention of her mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45539\" href=\"/chrysalis/4005-45539/\" slug=\"chrysalis\">Chrysalis</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">Captain Dynamo</a> was the much beloved superhero protector of Tower City. He was also a philanderer who cheated on his wife, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">Maddie Warner</a>, countless times with a slew of different women. One of these women was an alien whom Dynamo met in deep space when he came to the aid of her starship, which had broken down far from her home. After aiding in their repairs, he journeyed with her crew to her home planet (the name of which has not been revealed), where he had an affair with her, resulting in a pregnancy. Because of the cultural taboo of raising a \"half-breed\" on her world, she journeyed to Earth after Spencer was born to leave him in Dynamo's custody. Dynamo, however, had no interest in raising Spencer or threatening his marriage, so he left Spencer in the custody of a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45541\" href=\"/flag/4060-45541/\" slug=\"flag\">F.L.A.G.</a> (<b>F</b>oundation for <b>L</b>aw <b>a</b>nd <b>G</b>overnment) research facility, telling them not that Spencer was his son, but that he found the infant at an alien crash site. Spencer's home for the next few years was the research compound, where scientists subjected him to extensive study and experimentation, including exposing him to the same radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his superhuman abilities, not knowing what effect it would have on Spencer. This exposure activated Spencer's shapeshifting ability, which he inherited from Dynamo. He learned how to use this power to disguise his alien appearance, and to mimic the appearance of people around him, but one of the scientists in particular, an African-American woman named Dr. Bridges, took a liking to Spencer, and the two formed a rapport. The other scientists were not amenable to how Dr. Bridges was bonding with Spencer, and separated the two. Unable to convince Captain Dynamo to remove Spencer from the facility, Bridges had Spencer use his shapeshifting ability to smuggle him out of the compound. Knowing that she would be discovered by F.L.A.G. if she attempted to raise Spencer on her own, she placed Spencer, who maintained the appearance of a full human, in the care of child services. Because of this, the two never saw each other again. Spencer spent his childhood in an orphanage, and was placed in a succession of less-than-ideal foster homes. He struck out on his own at the age of thirteen. At some point Spencer took on Dr. Bridges' last name, though when he did so is unknown. The origin of his first name, and the point in his life at which he adopted it has also not been specified.</p><p>Following Captain Dynamo's assassination, Warner, a former government agent posing as now-retired investigative reporter, discovers from his personal effects that he had been unfaithful to her countless times. Despite her devastation at this discovery, Warner realizes that without a full-time protector, Tower City would be vulnerable to Captain Dynamo’s legion of super-villain enemies. She uses her skills to track down five people who could be Dynamo’s illegitimate children. She probably found Spencer through a notation in Dynamo's black books about Dr. Bridges.Spencer was the third person Warner contacted to be on the team. He agrees to join the team only because Maddie is paying him. Gathering all five of the children together, Warner exposes them to the same unidentified radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his powers forty years earlier, unlocking their powers. Neither Warner nor Spencer's siblings know that his powers had already been thus activated, nor that he is half alien. Spencer takes on the codename Myriad, and works to protect Tower City with his newly discovered brothers and sisters.</p><p>After fighting crime alongside his siblings for less than a year, Spencer comes to trust them, but does not tell them that he is a half alien. Maddie Warner and Jennifer Chang, the mother of Spencer's brother Visionary , are taken hostage by Dynamo 5's enemies, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52209\" href=\"/widowmaker/4005-52209/\" slug=\"widowmaker\">Widowmaker</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46195\" href=\"/voltage/4005-46195/\" slug=\"voltage\">Voltage</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48134\" href=\"/bonechill/4005-48134/\" slug=\"bonechill\">Bonechill</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49624\" href=\"/brains/4005-49624/\" slug=\"brains\">Brains</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49625\" href=\"/brawn/4005-49625/\" slug=\"brawn\">Brawn</a>, at the Aquarium, Dynamo 5's underwater headquarters. In the process of being rescued, Warner is rendered into a catatonic state, and Spencer, who tries to swim from the Aquarium to the surface, nearly drowns. In being rendered unconscious, he reverts to his true appearance, much to the shock of his siblings, who feel betrayed by his having kept his true nature a secret. Spencer sees this as hypocrisy, as all of his siblings have lied to their families about who their real father was, about their lives as superheroes, and allowed a murderer named Lionel Barstow to go free in order to free Neil Lewis, the father of Spencer's sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\">Slingshot</a>, who was being held hostage by Barstow's former employers. This argument does not convince Spencer's siblings, and as a result of both this revelation, Warner's condition, the flooding of the Aquarium, and the need to return to their civilian lives, the team seems to fall apart.</p><p>Despite this, Myriad decides to continue fighting crime in Tower City himself. He moves to a Tower City hotel, and uses his shapeshifting abilities to pose as a female masked vigilante named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55525\" href=\"/vigil/4005-55525/\" slug=\"vigil\">Vigil</a>, relying on his natural speed, martial arts and acrobatic abilities to fight crime. When he encounters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/scrap/4005-43664/\" slug=\"scrap\">Scrap</a>, the only other team member who decided to continue protecting Tower City, Scrap, not knowing that Vigil is her brother, decides to team up with Vigil, who poses as a native of Tower City. The two later recruit three other superheroes, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46191\" href=\"/quake/4005-46191/\" slug=\"quake\">Quake</a>, and the mother-daughter team the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56280\" href=\"/firebirds/4060-56280/\" slug=\"firebirds\">Firebirds</a>, into a new Dynamo 5 team. The new team suffers badly against Widowmaker, who assembles a team of supervillain mercenaries to attack them, and during this battle, Vigil is revealed to be Myriad. The team is joined by Slingshot, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\">Scatterbrain</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\" slug=\"visionary\">Visionary</a>, who manage to defeat their enemies. Although Quake and the elder Firebird are seriously injured, the Dynamo 5 siblings are reunited as a team.</p><p>Later after the team has reunited, it was revealed that in order compensate for the lack of offensive superhuman powers that lent themselves to combat situations that his siblings had, Spencer had been taking Flex, a street drug derived for the serum that turns humans into Whiptail, a monstrous, bipedal lizard. After he was discovered, he led his siblings and F.L.A.G. agent Augie Ford to his dealers, but agreed to stop taking the drug. He subsequently discovered, however, that his elevated strength, speed and endurance remained, which <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5198\" href=\"/doc-noble/4005-5198/\" slug=\"doc-noble\">Doc Noble</a> speculated occurred because it bonded to his extraterrestrial DNA.</p><p>The team was then attacked by their other half-sibling, Synergy, who used a weapon to erase the team's abilities and capture them. The team freed themselves, and used the weapon to restore their powers, but they manifested different abilities than the ones they previously had. Spencer found that he and his brother Gage, had switched their powers. Now possessing telepathy , Spencer took the new codename Wraith.</p><h2>Bomb Queen.</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/1277103-wraith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277103\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1538461538462\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/1277103-wraith.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277103\"><img alt=\"Wraith\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/1277103-wraith.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34678/1277103-wraith.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></a><figcaption>Wraith</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/406048-88846-myriad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406048\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/406048-88846-myriad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-406048\"><img alt=\"Myriad as an alien\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/406048-88846-myriad.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/406048-88846-myriad.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Myriad as an alien</figcaption></figure><p>Wraith was one of the heroes sent by <a href=\"../../barack-obama/29-56661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barack Obama</a> to confront <a href=\"../../bomb-queen/29-40609/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb Queen</a> in New Port City. He scanned her mind and confirmed that Obama is the father of her unborn child.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Spencer Bridges a promiscuous womanizer in his late teens who has never held a job for more than two weeks, though he seems never seems to be without financial means. <i>Dynamo 5</i> creator Jay Faerber has indicated that his shapeshifting ability will tie into his lack of direction in life, saying, \"He inherited Cap's shape-shifting powers, and he can now become anyone he chooses. Maybe one day he'll figure out who he wants to be.\" Shortly after meeting his siblings, Spencer tells them that the people who took him and other children in did so only to receive a government check, and while he can remember all their faces, he cannot remember half their names, and feels that today he doesn't need a family. Unlike his brother Hector, who thinks of Captain Dynamo as \"Dad\", and has a poster of Dynamo over his bed, Spencer, who, having wondered all his life who his father was, is disappointed to learn it was Captain Dynamo, and thinks of the late superhero as \"an enormous hypocrite and a horrible husband\". Despite Spencer's dismissive statements about his need for family, he undergoes an eye-opening experience when Maddie Warner asks him to impersonate his brother Gage after Gage falls into a coma, in order to quell suspicion on the part of Gage's family, who are unaware of Gage's superhero life. The experience servesd to illustrate to Spencer what having a stable family is like, something he had missed all his life, but in getting carried away, he initiates a romantic overture with a schoolmate of Gage's, and when Gage, who discoveres he is capable of astral projection, witnesses the two in a romantic embrace, he sees this as an invasion of privacy, and later comes to blows with Spencer. Spencer wonders if it is motivated by racism, as the girl in question was black. Spencer apologizes to Gage, but when he confessed how having a family for a small number of days made him feel, Gage, understanding of this, forgives him. Although he initially accepts Warner's offer to join the team because she pays him, he eventually decides to move to Tower City full-time and help protect it for more altruistic reasons.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164247\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3325\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164247\"><img alt=\"Myriad shifting his form\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Myriad shifting his form\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/164247-11051-myriad.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Myriad shifting his form</figcaption></figure><p>Myriad is a half human, half extraterrestrial hybrid. Although he uses his shapeshifting ability to appear human, his true appearance is that of a member of his mother's race. As such, he gray skin, no hair, and a long face that includes a pronounced brow, and a small, snout-like nose just under his eyes. The space between his nose and mouth is proportionately greater than that found in a human face, though he lacks a vertical groove on the upper lip . He also has no apparent ears, at least none that resemble those of a human. His hands have a total of three digits, including an opposable thumb, though his other two non-pollical digits are much larger than those of the human. All three of his digits have pointed claws.</p><p>Myriad has the superhuman ability to alter the form of his body, his facial features, and even the clothes he wears, in order to disguise himself as anyone he chooses. He sometimes practices his impersonations of certain people, and uses reference materials in order to perfect his disguises. Like his father, Myriad can alter the apparent size of his body, enabling him to disguise himself, for example, as an obese person. Myriad has used this ability to disguise himself as people who appear to have greater mass than he does, as when he impersonates Captain Dynamo. How he is able to do this, in light of the law of conservation of mass, has not been explained. When engaged in superheroics, Myriad does not wear a mask or helmet like his siblings, but instead disguises himself by erasing all of his facial features. How he is able to see, breathe, hear and speak without them has also not been explained. Myriad's ability to maintain a disguise is dependent upon his concentration; being punched in the face while disguised, for example, will cause that disguise to falter, and being rendered unconscious will cause him to revert to his true, alien appearance.</p><p>Myriad has also displayed considerable knowledge of martial arts and acrobatics. Although he has claimed that he has received training for it \"here and there\", he has relied on it considerably in hand-to-hand combat with expert combatants, in particular during his time as the vigilante Vigil. He has displayed speed, strength and agility that allows him to leap dozens of feet into the air and across rooftops, and single-handedly take on opponents such as Anchor, Chain Reaction and Blue Blaster. In his first confrontation with the assassin Widowmaker, she noted that he had some training, although she bested him and managed to escape. In their next encounter, he was able to briefly hold his own against Widowmaker and then against the physically enhanced warrior Optima, who was shocked at how his speed enabled him to evade her blows. The two villains managed to overpower Myriad together, but Myriad's remarkable speed was also remarked upon during his encounter with a villain using the Jessup-Poole strong-suit.</p>",

    "deck": "Maddie Warner was Captain Dynamo's wife. When he died she tracked down his illegitimate children and made them into a superhero team. She's also a secret agent. She is also the third Whiptail.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2>    <br/> <p>Madeline Warner was born <b>Madeline Moyer</b>. She was an agent of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45541\" href=\"/flag/4060-45541/\" slug=\"flag\">F.L.A.G.</a>, a U.S. government organization that deals with threats posed by superhuman beings, though she used the cover of an award-winning investigative journalist. Her partner was Augie Ford. She first met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">Captain Dynamo</a> (aka William Warner), the much-beloved protector of Tower City during a mission in which Dynamo saved her from the supervillain Red Scare. She eventually ended an engagement with a man named Tom in order to be with Captain Dynamo. They eventually married, though over the years, Dynamo's career as a costumed crimefighter often kept him away from home for extended periods of time, which put a strain on their marriage. Dynamo's absences were partially due to the numerous extramarital affairs that he had, including one in which he fathered a daughter with his archenemy, Chrysalis, whom he helped to raise, though Warner was unaware of this. Warner eventually retired from F.L.A.G. Following an argument with Warner over his absences, Dynamo engaged in a sexual liaison with the assassin <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52209\" href=\"/widowmaker/4005-52209/\" slug=\"widowmaker\">Widowmaker</a>, who killed Dynamo for an as-yet-unnamed client.</p> <p>Although Warner did not know this at the time, she did suspect that the condition and setting in which his body was found was not natural, but arranged by whoever murdered him in order to further tarnish his image. In sorting through his personal effects, Warner discovered his little black book, which was filled with detailed information on countless incidents of infidelity on his part. Although devastated by the extent of her late husband’s indiscretions, Warner was faced with the problem of Dynamo’s numerous enemies, who would now take advantage of Tower City in his absence. Although other superheroes attempted to pitch in to keep the peace, Warner decided that Tower City needed a permanent protector.</p> <p>Scouring through the information she gleaned from her husband’s belongings, she located five young people she believed could be his illegitimate children: Vancouver, British Columbia, high school geek <b><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\" slug=\"visionary\">Hector Chang</a></b>, Washington DC law student and activist <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\"></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingshot_(comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olivia “Livvie” Lewis</a>, aimless ne'er do well and ladies’ man <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\">Spencer Bridges</a>, Hollywood, California theater employee and NYU Film School graduate <b><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43664\" href=\"/scrap/4005-43664/\" slug=\"scrap\">Bridget Flynn</a></b>, and Eastbridge, Texas high school football star <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43659\" href=\"/scatterbrain/4005-43659/\" slug=\"scatterbrain\"></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gage_Reinhart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gage Reinhart</a>. Gathering them together, Warner exposed the five to the same radiation that Dynamo had been exposed to forty years earlier, unlocking their own latent superhuman abilities, with each one manifesting one of the five powers that their father possessed. Donning costumes and codenames, the five of them carry on his legacy as the superhero team the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">Dynamo 5</a>, while coming to terms with learning about the father they never knew, and the four new half-siblings they each now have. Warner is determined to mold them not only into a team, but into a family as well, and functions as their mentor and “unofficial sixth member”, keeping in constant remote contact with them during their missions from the Aquarium, the same headquarters once used by Captain Dynamo.</p> <p>Warner learned that Captain Dynamo also fathered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a> with<a data-ref-id=\"4005-45539\" href=\"/chrysalis/4005-45539/\" slug=\"chrysalis\"> Chrysalis</a>, and helped raise her, when the two supervillainesses kidnapped Warner. Warner foiled their attempt to murder her, had Scatterbrain wipe Synergy's memories, and left her in the care of a parish orphanage.</p> Warner was eventually confronted by Widowmaker, who invaded the Aquarium with a group of the team's assembled adversaries, for the purpose of killing the team. Widowmaker revealed that it was she who killed Captain Dynamo. During the encounter, Warner fell into a comatose state as a result of a telepathic attack by the villainess <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49624\" href=\"/brains/4005-49624/\" slug=\"brains\">Brains</a>. She was eventually brought out of this state by the telepath Scatterbrain.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline_“Maddie”_Warner#cite_note-D5.2317-0\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span></span></a>  <br/><br/><h2>Personality</h2><br/><p>Warner is determined to mold Dynamo 5 not only into a team, but into a family as well, and functions as their mentor and “unofficial sixth member\".<span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"></span> Although she must deal with the fact that they are constant reminders of her late husband’s infidelity, she is insistent that they act not only as a team, but as a family as well. Visionary has described her as \"a hard one to warm up\", \"no nonsense, all business\", and \"more of adrill instructor than a den mother.\"</p><p>Warner has also been depicted as a long-term tactician willing to resort to creative solutions to problems, including those that might be considered ethically questionable. Two weeks after Warner began training Dynamo 5 to act as a team, the team began to chafe under her strict demands, and insisted that they were ready for their first mission. In response she sent them to Tower City, where they were soundly beaten by a quintet of villains who, unbeknownst to Dynamo 5, were really Warner's allies, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55524\" href=\"/the-noble-family/4060-55524/\" slug=\"the-noble-family\">Noble Family</a>, in disguise, whom Warner enlisted to prove her point to the team that they were not yet ready.</p> <p>Warner's use of radical, even dangerous ideas, extends to life-threatening situations. Following the defeat of the reptilian monster known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46188\" href=\"/whiptail/4005-46188/\" slug=\"whiptail\">Whiptail</a>, she absconded with several vials of the serum that transforms humans into the creature. She saved these vials for a \"rainy day\", and later injected herself with a vial of the serum when she was about to murdered by the villainesses <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45539\" href=\"/chrysalis/4005-45539/\" slug=\"chrysalis\">Chrysalis</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">Synergy</a>, even though being transformed into Whiptail renders a person completely feral, and lacking in their human intelligence or judgment. Although Dynamo 5 had been captured by F.L.A.G. at this point, and Warner had no way to plan the scenario beyond using the serum to escape her would-be murderers, their battle took them from Chrysalis' mountain hideout to Tower City, where the escaped Dynamo 5 eventually intervened. After Warner was rendered unconscious by Scrap, she reverted back to her human form.</p> <p>Despite her matronly role and demeanor with the team, Warner can be ruthless with enemies that she perceives to be threats, and will not hesitate to kill them, as she did with The Superior, the leader of an organization called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45540\" href=\"/veil/4060-45540/\" slug=\"veil\">The Veil</a>, that had kidnapped Visionary, even though Visionary had been returned, and the Superior had been captured. Remarking on the fact that the team is unaware that she is a former agent of F.LA.G., she commented ominously in <i>Dynamo 5</i> #1, “Kind of makes you wonder what else I never told them, doesn’t it?” Warner's uncompromising willingness to achieve her goals have also brought her into conflict with members of the team and their loved ones. Gage's difficulty in finding time for both his high school career and his superheroics, has led to sleeplessness, and tension between him and Warner. Jennifer Chang, the mother of Hector Chang (aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\" slug=\"visionary\">Visionary</a>), after discovering his son's life as a superhero, was angered at learning that Warner exposed her son to a heavy dose of radiation to unlock his powers, and after having Hector introduce them, she threatened to report Warner to the authorities for what she regarded as child endangerment and possibly kidnapping. Warner insisted that because his children shared Captain Dynamo's DNA, the radiation posed no risk to them, and speculated that Jennifer's ire was motivated more from feeling abandoned by the man who seduced her, but Jennifer was not amused by this statement.</p> When probing her memories during his attempt to bring her out of her coma, Scatterbrain observed that Warner tends to accept a disproportionate amount of responsibility for various unfortunate events in her life, and harbors guilt over those incidents. It was in convincing Warner of her need to move beyond her guilt that Scatterbrain was able to bring her out of the coma.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline_“Maddie”_Warner#cite_note-D5.2317-0\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span></span></a>    ",

    "deck": "Originally named Slingshot due to her flight powers, Livvie is one of Captain Dynamo's illegitimate kids. After an energy ray changed her powers, Livvie took the name  Menagerie and can now change shape.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a> <h2>History</h2><br/> <p>Olivia \"Livvie\" Lewis' biological mother passed away when Livvie was young enough to require her adoptive father and her mother's widow, Neil Lewis, a high-priced, Washington DC lawyer, to learn how to cook. Livvie is a junior at Georgetown University, an overachiever, and a driven activist who is involved with half a dozen different volunteer organizations and extracurricular activities, which include working as a reporter for G.U.'s campus newspaper, The Hoya, and volunteering at a clinic. Her workaholic nature leaves less time for her boyfriend Derrick than he’d like.</p> <p>Following the assassination of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">  Captain Dynamo</a>, the much-beloved superhero protector of Tower City, his widow, a former government agent posing as a now-retired investigative reporter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">  Maddie Warner</a>, discovered from his personal effects that he had been unfaithful to her countless times. Despite her devastation at this discovery, Warner realized that without a full-time protector, Tower City would be vulnerable to Captain Dynamo’s legion of super-villain enemies. Maddie used her skills and the information she discovered to track down five people who could be Dynamo’s illegitimate children.</p> <p>Livvie was the second of Captain Dynamo’s children that Warner contacted, and the second oldest. Gathering all five of the children together, Warner exposed them to the same unidentified radiation that gave Captain Dynamo his powers forty years earlier, unlocking their powers. Livvie inherited her father’s ability of flight, took the codename Slingshot, and works to protect Tower City with her newly discovered brothers and sisters.</p> <p>As a member of Dynamo 5, Slingshot is dedicated and attentive. She is respectful and reserved towards Maddie Warner, usually referring to and addressing her as \"Ma'am\", or \"Mrs. Warner\", and eschewing profanity in her presence. She finds Warner's writings as a journalist to be \"brilliant\", and objects to her brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\">  Spencer</a>'s view that this deference is an attempt on her part to \"suck up\" to Warner. She is not completely deferential to Warner, however. For example, in the team's first year, she angrily refuses to comply with Warner's order that she and her siblings stay in Tower City to protect it after she learned of her father's kidnapping.</p> <p>Neil Lewis was kidnapped by the former employers of an assassin named Lionel Barstow. These employers blackmailed her into freeing Barstow, but after she and her siblings did so, Barstow killed his ex-employers with his \"death touch\". Barstow explained that after he was captured, his attorney, Neil Lewis, advised him to testify against his employers. Although Slingshot's siblings are outraged at learning that they freed a murderer, Slingshot is more concerned with getting her father to safety than returning Barstow to the authorities, a decision that later serves as a source of tension among the team, Livvie later finds Barstow and returns him to the authorities, despite his threat to use her secret identity as a bargaining chip with them.</p> <p>Neil Lewis was profoundly disturbed to discover his daughter's secret when she rescued him, and pained to learn that Livvie's mother cheated on him with Captain Dynamo. Livvie, however, recalling her feeling of betrayal with Spencer, sympathized with him, but reassured her father that because of Dynamo's shapeshifting ability, he could have impersonated Neil himself when he fathered Livvie, and that Livvie's mother may not have truly cheated on Neil. <br/> <br/>Recently in a battle with Synergy and Maddie's son, Father Gideon, the powers of the Dynamo 5 were switched.  Livvie lost the ability to fly but gained the ability to change shape.  Livvie's shape changing skills are more advanced than her brother's.  Livvie can change both size and shape where her siblings could only transform their shape.<br/></p> <br/> <h2>Powers </h2><br/> <p>With her original powers, Livvie had the superhuman ability to defy gravity, and fly under her own power. The top speed and altitude she can achieved unaided is currently unknown, but she is able to use this ability to be an effective fighter in battles. In one encounter with the reptilian monster known as Whiptail, she was able to fly around the creature fast enough to create a miniature tornado, causing it dizziness, without suffering any ill effects herself. Although she did not inherit her father’s superhuman strength, she is able to generate extra thrust while in flight, as she is able to carry another person when flying. She also uses the speed she can generate while in flight to knock out an opponent with the impact of a single punch. Whether this is a physiological adaptation that exists as part of her flight power, or a result of reinforced gloves, is unclear.  <br/> <br/>Now, Livvie has the ability to change her size and shape.  She has been seen to transform from a creature the size of a cat to a full sized rhino.  Unlike other's with the shape changing ability, Livvie can't  transform to look like another human although this may be a limitation due only to her lack of control.<br/> <br/><br/></p>",

    "deck": "Scrap is one of six  of Captain Dynamo's illegitimate kids. Upon exposure to Radiation she inherited his super strength and near invulnerability.  She has lost her original powers and now has supervision",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a> <h2>History</h2><br/>Cleveland native Bridget Flynn was raised by her biological mother and her mother's husband, Bridget's adoptive father, though her father does not know that he is not Bridget's biological father. After graduating from NYU Film School, she moved to Los Angeles, where, now in her early twenties, she works at a Hollywood California movie theater while pursuing her dreams of being a screenwriter  <p>Following the assassination of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43658\" href=\"/captain-dynamo/4005-43658/\" slug=\"captain-dynamo\">    Captain Dynamo</a>, the much-beloved superhero protector of Tower City, his widow, former government agent posing as a now-retired investigative reporter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">    Maddie Warner</a>, discovered from his personal effects that he had been unfaithful to her countless times. Despite her devastation at this discovery, Warner realized that without a full-time protector, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-46734\" href=\"/tower-city/4020-46734/\" slug=\"tower-city\">    Tower City </a>would be vulnerable to Captain Dynamo’s legion of Super-villian enemies. She used her skills and the information she discovered to track down five people who could be Dynamo’s illegitimate children.</p> <p> <br/>Bridget was the fourth of the five children contacted by Warner, and the oldest.Gathering all five of the children together, Warner exposes them to the same unidentified radiation that gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\">    Captain Dynamo </a>his powers forty years earlier, unlocking their powers. Bridget inherits her father’s super strength and invulnerability. She took the codename Scrap, and works to protect Tower City with her newly discovered brothers and sisters. Warner offers to put Bridget in touch with one of the entertainment reporters from the newspaper where she once worked, but Bridget, who admits that she isn't good at \"schmoozing\", declines the offer, explaining that she doesn't want special treatment. Shortly after gaining her powers, Bridget's father paid her an unexpected visit a few days before Father's day. Suspicious of his reasons for the visit, he reluctantly told her that he and her mother had separated because they were no longer in love, which caused much pain for Bridget.</p> <p> <br/>A year after the team is formed, following Warner's descent into a coma, the flooding of the Aquarium, the team's headquarters, and the discovery that Scrap's brother and teammate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43661\" href=\"/myriad/4005-43661/\" slug=\"myriad\">    Myriad</a> is a half-extraterrestrial with an alien appearance, the team falls apart, but Scrap remains in Tower City to protect it.   She enlists the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56280\" href=\"/firebirds/4060-56280/\" slug=\"firebirds\">    Firebirds</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46191\" href=\"/quake/4005-46191/\" slug=\"quake\">     Quake </a>and new heroine <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55525\" href=\"/vigil/4005-55525/\" slug=\"vigil\">    Vigil</a>.  The temporary team disbands after the siblings reunite.  She subsequently decided to move from Los Angeles to Tower City full time. <br/> <br/>A plot organized by Maddie's deranged son Michael found the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\" href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" slug=\"dynamo-5\">    Dynamo 5</a> stripped of their powers.  However after receiving a second dose of the radiation their powers were returned, sort of.  When Bridget punched evil half sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">    Synergy</a> she had none of her strength or durability.  Synergy was about to hurt her sister and but was caught by surprise when Bridget manifested her brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43660\" href=\"/visionary/4005-43660/\" slug=\"visionary\">    Visionary's </a>energy blast.  The team was able to convince Synergy that they had not animocity towards her and that Michael had no intentions of helping her free her mother.  Synergy fled at the realization.  While trying to come to grips with her new abilities,  Maddie informs her that she is appointing her the new team leader, a fact she argues with as she didn't want to take the position away from her sister.  Maddie convinces her that she does not have any problems with Oliva's leadership skills, but that during her time as the only member of the Dynamo 5 that she has grown to be come a better leader than her sister.  Bridget turns down using Hector's helmet and visor chosing to fashion a pair of goggles instead.  She now goes by the name Supervision. <br/> <br/>Bridget has developed a friendship with her biological half-sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43663\" href=\"/slingshot/4005-43663/\" slug=\"slingshot\">    Olivia Lewis</a>.     <br/>  <br/>Bridget has a labret piercing, below the lip but above the chin.  <br/> <br/><br/></p> <h2>Power </h2> <p> <br/>Bridget originally developed super strength from the radiation administered by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43662\" href=\"/maddie-warner/4005-43662/\" slug=\"maddie-warner\">    Maddie Warner</a>. She also possess a modicum of invulnerablity, as evidenced when she took a full charge of electricity from the villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46195\" href=\"/voltage/4005-46195/\" slug=\"voltage\">    Voltage</a>. She tends to throw large objects at her foes, but her aim leaves something to be desired.    <br/> </p>Bridget Flynn has superhuman abilities related to her eyesight, which   include laser vision, X-ray vision and telescopic vision,<a href=\"///\"> </a>  which were formerly the powers possessed by her brother, <a href=\"///\">   Hector Chang</a>.   Her powers appear to function exactly as her brother's did.   Her laser vision is used as an offensive weapon and can be used to   neutralize human opponents and large objects. They also possess a  concussive aspect that can batter targets and demolish walls.   Her x-ray vision allows her to see through solid objects.   Her brother also possessed telescopic vision, allowing him to see  great distances,   but Bridget has not yet been depicted displaying this ability. Bridget   wears goggles that, like the helmet formerly worn by her brother,   focuses her laser blasts, making them more concentrated.   Despite the power she wields, she is reluctant to kill or cause   life-threatening injury in battle.<br/><p><br/>Her previous powers as Scrap were superhuman strength and invulnerability. The upper limit of her strength is unknown, but she has been observed lifting a tank over her head, and throwing it the length of a city block, and destroying large powered amour suits by kicking them, without sustaining any injury. On another occasion, Scrap was able to easily survive being pushed off a skyscraper by her half-sister Synergy (who also possesses their father's superhuman strength), smashed through the street below to a set of underground subway tracks, and further kicks to the abdomen by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46194\" href=\"/synergy/4005-46194/\" slug=\"synergy\">    Synergy</a>, without more than a moment's incapacitation. She easily shrugs off automatic weapons fire.On the other hand, electricity of a sufficient power level can temporarily stun her, and a direct punch from the supervillain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49625\" href=\"/brawn/4005-49625/\" slug=\"brawn\">    Brawn</a> was able to knock her into unconsciousness or semi-consciousness for several moments.  Scrap has shown a reluctance to kill or cause life-threatening injury in battle.  After the her first encounter with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48134\" href=\"/bonechill/4005-48134/\" slug=\"bonechill\">    Bonechill</a>, she practiced holding her breath, and can currently hold it for twenty minutes.  <br/></p><br/>",

That night after he had gone back to sleep he transformed into a werewolf and rampaged through town and even went as far as killing a man. The next morning Gary found all his injuries had been healed. A month later while he was at home he transformed into the creature again during the night and killed a rabbit. When he awoke the next morning he found his clothing torn to shreds so he checked the security cameras only to discover what he had become. He was then confronted by a vampire named <a href=\"/zechariah/4005-45677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45677\">Zechariah</a> who offered to help him control his newly discovered powers. In a matter of three weeks he had nearly full control of his beastly form. He also discovered he no longer needed to sleep because of the lunar energy he absorbs during the night. The next day he debuted during a fire and was dubbed the Wolf-Man by the media. Zechariah took him to the <a href=\"/art/4005-49608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49608\">Art</a> to get a superhero outfit and his superhero career officially began. He managed to help a group of super heroes called the Actioneers fight some form of slime beast. He quickly left because he still felt too new to meet any real heroes. The next night he stayed home and while he was getting intimate with his wife his transformation was triggered but he could not control it, he fled his home, went into town, and he slaughtered Sergeant Superior, one of the heroes he had helped earlier.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Two weeks later we find Gary, looking depressed, sitting inside what appears to be the base that was being built. When Zechariah arrives Gary goes wolf and lunges at him. It's revealed that Zec has not been around for the last two weeks, ever since Gary killed Sergeant Superior. Zec explains everything and tells Gary it was suppose to happen just as severely as it had. Zec reveals that on the first day of every full moon Gary will become a feral werewolf holding only a very little part of his psyche inside that will protect anyone truly close to him. Gary apologizes and explains that he'll start patrolling again soon. When Gary returns home he is a bit unnerving and reinforces to his wife he still loves her and they'll be OK. The next day Gary returns to patrolling where we see the mysterious car in action driven by Zechariah. It manages to fling Gary into the air to catch a villain called <a href=\"/thrill-kill/4005-47842/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47842\">Thrill Kill</a> who kidnapped a woman. After Gary chases him across the rooftops, Thrill Kill tries to bargain with him by dropping the girl and forcing Gary to make a choice between defeating him and saving the girl. Gary lunges at him and they both fall off the roof, they battle in midair, and Gary manages to save the girl before they hit the ground. When they land the police try to arrest Gary which the woman defends him against while he exits.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Gary returns, he find the car damaged and Zec being held captive by a group of werewolves who call Gary \"Elder Brood\". He battles them and they run saying they were not prepared for an \"Elder Brood\". When Gary regroups with Zec he has many questions that Zec refuses to answer. The next day Gary tells his wife that he was fired and that some of the house keeping and luxuries they have will need to be cutback on. <a href=\"/dunford/4005-45308/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45308\">Dunford</a>, Gary's butler, appears and explains that there are men had the door who are basically evicting Gary. Gary apologizes to his wife and says it's all falling apart.</p><figure style=\"width: 400px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/408305-173787-wolf-man-s-lair.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-408305\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.38\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/408305-173787-wolf-man-s-lair.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-408305\"><img alt=\"New Home\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/408305-173787-wolf-man-s-lair.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/408305-173787-wolf-man-s-lair.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>New Home</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the family moved out of there house they moved into Gary's secret underground base. When his daughter arrived he felt it was time to show her his new self. He wolfed out on her and she was shocked, Dunford helped her to her room while she was in shock. That night Gary and Zec went out again, just as Gary was noticing how quiet it was he got a whiff of trouble and the werewolf group from before attacked him. Gary accidentally killed one because he was so aggressive. He explained to the group but they were only concerned in how powerful he was and could become. They started to tell Gary of all the secrets Zec has been keeping and that Gary is on the wrong side. The lead wolf begins attacking Gary demanding him to reveal Zec's location. Gary is beaten to a pulp and then the lead wolf explains that if Gary new the truth he would want to kill Zec as well. Zec shows up to protect Gary. He tells him to revert to human form than change back again. Zec and the lead wolf begin to argue, and after awhile it is revealed that Zec was once their friend until his blood lust drove him to killing an young female werewolf. Gary demands to know if the accusation is true and Zec confirms it but tries to give an excuse.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The werewolf group begins telling Gary that Zec only trained him to be a bodyguard from them. Gary begins screaming at Zec asking him if he wanted his blood and saying how much he trusted him. Gary snaps and chops off Zec's head with his claws, seemingly killing him. The lead wolf, revealed to be named Jacobson, attempts to take the head as a trophy, but Gary insisted that, because it was his kill, he should dispatch the body. Jacobson commemorates him and says he has made a powerful ally in him. When the werewolf group leaves, Zec returns in a misted form. It turns out the death was ploy and Gary still believes in Zec despite what he's done and doesn't feel Zec has to prove himself. Zec thanks him for their friendship. The pair part agreeing to meet again tomorrow night.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The next night Gary stops Eruptor from killing people at the offices of The New Tribune, later that day Gary and Rebbecca are talking about what are they going to do the next full moon, meanwhile their daughter is still trying to deal with the fact that her dad is a werewolf. That night Zechariah explains why Jacobson called him \"Elder Brood.\" Gary finds out that he was not attacked by not just any werewolf he was attacked by an elder werewolf. Which are the oldest, and most powerful werewolves alive. Zechariah explains that they don't attack just anyone they choose who they attack. Gary then battles Construct and with the aid of Kid Thor she is defeated and sent to jail. Gary and Zechariah agree to try and find the elder who turned him. The next night Chloe walks into a room where her father is locked up so he cant attack his family or anyone. Rebecca tells Chloe that her father will need to do this every mouth but it will get better. Chloe says \"Will it ever get better, what if it keeps getting worse?\"</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One night while Gary and Zechariah were patrolling the city they noticed Capes, Inc. was under attack and he joined in the fight. Wolf-Man and Zechariah were captured. Wolf-Man was the only hero able to break out of his prison, he aided Invincible and Atom Eve in battle. Even with Zechariah's help all four heroes fell. When backup arrived, all the heroes were freed.

Chloe is at a tennis match against one her rich friends named: Carly. Chloe lost the game to her and goes to congratulate her, but her kindness is met with the disgust for her. Carly doesn't care and is embarrassed just for playing against her. Treating her like she is a different species from her by saying: \"Your Kind\", all because everyone now knows that her family got kicked out of her house and are poor. Out of anger Chloe strikes down Carly with her tennis racket. Later, the family returns to \" <a href=\"/wolf-mans-lair/4020-55606/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55606\">Wolf-Man's Lair</a>\" and Chloe immediately storms off to her room. Rebbecca goes to talk to her. Rebbecca finds out that Chloe is the laughing stock of her school and is now called the \"Homeless girl\". Chloe than says \"I think I hate him\" (Out of anger to her Father [Gary]). Gary is upset and leaves for the night. Gary (Now in Werewolf form) is running across a rooftop with Zechariah trying to talk to him. But Gary is just ignoring him and when Zech asks what's wrong, Gary says: \"Blowing off some steam\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Jumping off the rooftop Gary lands on a car, and totally destroys the front part of it, that appears to being chased by the cops. The man in the car flies through the front wind-shield and Gary catches him before he hits the ground. The man is a scientist and says: Not cops......Never running from the cops. Running from <i>Him</i>.\" A giant man appears leaping towards the scientist. Gary tries to protect and stay away from him as long as he can. Rebbecca is shown meeting a man named: Nathan, at a restaurant. She says: Nathan--Please. The Last thing in the world I came here to do is talk about Gary\". Mecha-Maid is shown to be near the scene of Garys' fight. She tells the rest of the Auctioneer that she has located their target. Mecha-Maid comments on how the Giant man is a human battery. That he absorbed Kinetic energy to get stronger. Using her advanced technology she found a way to turn him off. The scientist returns with a bunch of men and he's ordering them to get him in the car, quickly. Kinetic finally appears at the scene and immediately attacks Gary, shouting: \"MURDERER!\". Gary punches her off of him and the rest of the Auctioneers show up. Gary is trying to explain to them on what happened, but none of them will listen. Kinetic orders everyone back so she can have him, all to herself. Not giving Gary a chance to move she continues beating on him until the rest of the Actioneers start second guessing on whats happening.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Then Sergeant Superior</p><figure style=\"width: 336px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-438127\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.52678571428571\" data-width=\"336\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-438127\"><img alt=\"The break-up\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" data-width=\"336\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg 336w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The break-up\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11863/438127-wolfman07_p4_1_.jpg 336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" data-width=\"336\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The break-up</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">finally shows up. But he is not truly back. He has actually become a vampire. Sergeant Superior gets the rest of the team to stop attacking him and he then escapes. He quickly meets Zechariah. Of course Gary is upset that Zechariah never told Gary that he brought Superior back to life and was some what upset he brought him back as a vampire. He tells Zechariah he never wants to see him again and wants him to stay out of his life. He returns to the base and Rebbecca informs him that his lawyers called an they can now move back in their home, but she wants to go without Gary. She wants to separate for some time and Gary is devastated by this.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He leaves the room and talks to Dunford about how he wishes he was never Wolf-man and how he thought it would be a good thing to be able to physically do some good. He soon sees Rebecca again and after a short talk the two kiss. After she leaves the room Zec appears wanting Rebbecca's help in getting Gary to trust him again so he can help him, but she is upset over what Gary previously told her and she scratches him when she tries struggles to get free. He becomes furious and back hands her so hard he turned her head around killing her. He begins to panic guilty over what he did, but he then is over come by his vampire urges that he begins to feed on her dead body. Gary walks in and transforms in a fury. Zec tries to explain that due to feeding on Sergeant Superior's super human blood he is over come with the need to feed and lost track of his needs. He soon vanishes and Gary begins to cradle Rebbecca's dead body. Chloe soon walks in seeing her mother dead and Gary transformed now covered in blood and starts crying no doubt believing he killed her. Dunford walks in and Gary asks him to watch Chloe and Gary then leaves. Later it is shown that Sergeant Superior had butchered the team and tore them to pieces, but they then begin to rise now vampires in Zec's home and Superior addresses him as master.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the death of Rebecca Gary goes on the run since he is the one believed to have committed the crime instead of Zec. He ends up on the road and makes his way back to Willow Creek Campground the place where he was attacked and turned into a werewolf. It is there where he discovers the <a href=\"/the-elder/4005-59636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59636\">Elder Brood</a> that gave him his powers. The Elder Brood told him that he gave him his powers because he wanted him to kill Zechariah. The Elder Brood begins to train Gary to better use his powers and meanwhile he is being hunted by an immortal government agent <a href=\"/agent-hunter/4005-60112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60112\">Hunter</a>. Even worse Chloe has grown to hate her father for thinking he killed her mother and has gone to Zec to ask him to help her kill her father not knowing that it is in fact Zec who murdered her.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gary continues to run from the authorities who thinks he killed his wife. Soon other super heroes give chase. Giant began to attack the forest where Wolf-man was and he tried to stop him. <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> found Gary and attacked him.

Gary tries to fight them on his own using martial arts skills he got from the Elder but they don't work to well and Hunter arrests Gary. Meanwhile Chloe leaves home and Zechariah has been training Chloe so that she can take her revenge on her father. However she still isn't powerful enough to kill him so Zec has been feeding her his blood. Luckily it only gives her temporary powers as he is now willing to turn her into a vampire no matter what.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gary is eventually taken to a super prison along with Eruptor, Thrill Kill and Construct who were recently beaten by the Elder Brood. After Thrill Kill kills a guard protecting Gary he is beaten by the guards. Later he is brought to see a criminal named the Face who still has pulled strings even in prison. He offers to help Gary but Gary refuses and takes his chances with the guards. Things change when Dunford comes to visit. He tells him that Chloe left and he can't find her so Gary goes to Face and promises to do whatever he wants if he helps him find her. The first thing Face does is remove Gary's power draining collar and Gary turns into a werewolf and kills a guard.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally Zechariah, Chloe and the vampire Actioneers attack the prison hoping to kill Wolf-Man. Zechariah goes toe to toe with Wolf-Man. Due to Gary's training with the Elder Brood he can better fight Zec and even wounds him by sucking in his mist form and then chewing off his arm. Meanwhile the Actioneers fight with the supervillains as well as the prison guards. Wolf-Man and Zec's fight finally goes his way and he manages to stake Zec with a piece of wood. Chloe shows up and Gary tries to talk to her and explain what really happened with her mother. Gary goes to hug her and she stabs him in the chest.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">He takes the sword out and tries to give it back to her saying he won't fight against her. She says she's sorry for what she's done but they are both attacked by Thrill Kill and <a href=\"/kursk/4005-42570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42570\">Kursk</a>. They beat the two but the Actioneers are still fighting with the prisoners and guards, but <a href=\"/capes-inc/4060-55235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55235\">Capes Inc</a> and <a href=\"/cecil-stedman/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil</a> show up. Still working with the Face, Gary leaves with <a href=\"/eruptor/4005-52631/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52631\">Eruptor</a> and Construct and takes Mech-Maid with him since she was hurt in the fight. Cecil arrested the Actioneers and even found a still living Zec and arrests him. He also takes Chloe with him to keep her safe. Meanwhile Gary and Mecha-Maid are flying with the Face and his people. He asks Gary to use his contacts to go to the next part of his plan. Meanwhile he is being watched by another werewolf.</p><h2>Gadgets</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>The Suit</b>- The suit appears to be comprised of a black spandex uniform under a bulletproof chest piece with a <a href=\"/thundercats/4060-15972/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15972\">Thundercat</a>-esque Wolf symbol, two large gauntlets with lunar energy absorbing discs for extended transformation past night time, and some form of armored boots with the toes cut off for use of the claws on his feet. <b>The Base</b>- There seems to be some sort of base being setup for Gary's use. Zechariah has mind controlled construction workers to build it, but he is paying them well for the job and they believe they're building a mall to hide Gary's identity. The base was revealed in issue three, although now in detail. It appears to be very large. <b>The Car</b>- Zechariah asked about a vehicle in the works and Gary assured him even though it was still in design phase it would be up and running soon. In issue three it is revealed that a car was being built for Zechariah to drive. The car is a fog grayish color with a black Wolf-Man insignia on the front. On the rear hood of the car there is a launchpad that is used to fling Gary onto rooftops and other high areas out of reach. Details are still vague as of now.</p>",

    "deck": "Ulgulu is a barghest, one of two sent to the area around the village of Malobar to feed on the inhabitants and grow strong enough to return to its home on the lower plane of Gehenna.",
    "description": "<p>Up in the mountains above Malobar, dwelt two creatures of Gehenna called barghests. Demonic creatures, they were near maturity and had been sent to the material plane to feed on the flesh of humans and grow strong enough to return home. Ulgulua, the older of the two, is informed by one of their servants of the slaying of the gnoll by a drow. In anger, Ulgulu bites the head off the messenger, and conferes with his brother, Kempfana, as to what they should do about a dark elf in their domain. Kempfana suggests that they use the drow as a scapegoat to explain the disappearances that have occurred since they came to the area. Ulgulu decides to investigate and sends his pet quickling, Tephanis, to gather more information.</p> Meanwhile, Liam Thistledown and his siblings have a run-in with Drizzt. By the next morning, the entire community of Malobar had heard the rumor of the dark elf. The town's mayor, Bartholomew Delmo sends a request to nearby Sundabar for a ranger to come and help deal with situation. A local huntsman, Roddy McGristle, is skeptical that Conner saw what he says he saw, but volunteers himself to track whatever creature this might be, and organizes a search party on the spot. That afternoon, a body of men were led into the nearby forest by Roddy's bloodhounds, and Drizzt shadowed them easily. He wanted to reveal himself, but understood they would likely see him as an enemy. While lost in his reverie, the quickling Tephanis dashes by, slashing Drizzt's wrist and stealing a scimitar. Drizzt cries out, in surprise more than pain, and is heard by Roddy and his dogs. Calling on Guenhwyvar as a distraction, Drizzt hoped to get away, but the bloodhounds have clearly picked up his scent and catch up to him easily. When one bursts through the brush to attack, Drizzt cuts it down instinctively, and finds himself in a battle with Roddy. Not desiring to hurt the hunter, he dashed and ducked out of the way. Roddy's great battleaxe caught on a nearby tree, cutting in down to fall on top of him, smashing him in the face. Drizzt runs as quickly as he can and loses himself in the forest.<p>Later that night, the barghest Ulgulu comes down off of his mountain carrying the stolen scimitar of Drizzt. All barghests are shape-shifters, and so Ulgulu took on the form of Drizzt and strode into the farmhouse of the Thistledowns. As Conner and his father, Conner Sr., sat discussing the events of the day's hunt, the false drow bursts into their home, slaughtering the entire family. The next morning, Drizzt warily came down out of the mountains, hoping the search was no longer on.  He hoped to reveal himself to the Thistledowns and make his peace with the locals, but when he arrives no one is yet stirring about the farm. Drizzt decides to sit and wait, but when there has been no activity from morning through late afternoon to evening, he began to sense something was amiss. He walks down and into the house, finding the murdered Thistledowns in gruesome display all about the house. Drizzt was shocked with his failure to protect the family, and immediately vowed to avenge their deaths.</p><p>The next morning, Drizzt takes his weapons and Guen and trudges up into the mountains, where all the signs of the murderous creature pointed. As they neared the hiding place of his new enemy, he heard the familiar sound of the running creature that had stung him and stole his scimitar. Not caugh unawares this time, he catches the little beast, a quickling name Tephanis, and forces to tell him who killed the farmers. After giving the name and location of the barghest Ulgulu, the green-skinned little creature stabs Drizzt in the hand to try and get away, but Drizzt ignores the pain, smashes the quickling against a rock, and throws it down into the valley below. He pulls the tiny dagger out of his hand and walks on.</p> At the barghest's cave, he is confronted by two goblins, which he promptly slays and enters the cave. Inside, he finds the two demonic fiends standing inside, and immediately slips into The Hunter. Ulgulu, thinking he's found easy prey and a final meal on the material plane, jumps toward the drow but is stopped in mid-air by Guen. Drizzt turns to attack Kempfana, and is set to hopping to stay out of the huge beast's reach. Ulgulua shapeshifts into a great demon wolf after Guen bites him in the shoulder, and chases Guen from the cave. Kempfana, meanwhile, has caught Drizzt and is holding him up by the neck. When the barghest opens his mouth to bite off Drizzt's head, the dark elf shoves his scimitar through the back of the demon's mouth, impaling his brain. Released, Drizzt rushes out to see Ulgulu trap Guen near the canyon edge. When the demon wolf jumps, Drizzt uses the figurine to send Guen home, causing Ulgulu to miss entirely and plummet to the canyon floor below to certain death.",

    "deck": "Kempfana is a barghest, one of two sent to the area around the village of Malobar to feed on the inhabitants and grow strong enough to return to its home on the lower plane of Gehenna.",
    "description": "<p>Up in the mountains above Malobar, dwelt two creatures of Gehenna called barghests. Demonic creatures, they were near maturity and had been sent to the material plane to feed on the flesh of humans and grow strong enough to return home. Ulgulua, the older of the two, is informed by one of their servants of the slaying of the gnoll by a drow. In anger, Ulgulu bites the head off the messenger, and conferes with his brother, Kempfana, as to what they should do about a dark elf in their domain. Kempfana suggests that they use the drow as a scapegoat to explain the disappearances that have occurred since they came to the area. Ulgulu decides to investigate and sends his pet quickling, Tephanis, to gather more information.</p> Meanwhile, Liam Thistledown and his siblings have a run-in with Drizzt. By the next morning, the entire community of Malobar had heard the rumor of the dark elf. The town's mayor, Bartholomew Delmo sends a request to nearby Sundabar for a ranger to come and help deal with situation. A local huntsman, Roddy McGristle, is skeptical that Conner saw what he says he saw, but volunteers himself to track whatever creature this might be, and organizes a search party on the spot. That afternoon, a body of men were led into the nearby forest by Roddy's bloodhounds, and Drizzt shadowed them easily. He wanted to reveal himself, but understood they would likely see him as an enemy. While lost in his reverie, the quickling Tephanis dashes by, slashing Drizzt's wrist and stealing a scimitar. Drizzt cries out, in surprise more than pain, and is heard by Roddy and his dogs. Calling on Guenhwyvar as a distraction, Drizzt hoped to get away, but the bloodhounds have clearly picked up his scent and catch up to him easily. When one bursts through the brush to attack, Drizzt cuts it down instinctively, and finds himself in a battle with Roddy. Not desiring to hurt the hunter, he dashed and ducked out of the way. Roddy's great battleaxe caught on a nearby tree, cutting in down to fall on top of him, smashing him in the face. Drizzt runs as quickly as he can and loses himself in the forest.<p>Later that night, the barghest Ulgulu comes down off of his mountain carrying the stolen scimitar of Drizzt. All barghests are shape-shifters, and so Ulgulu took on the form of Drizzt and strode into the farmhouse of the Thistledowns. As Conner and his father, Conner Sr., sat discussing the events of the day's hunt, the false drow bursts into their home, slaughtering the entire family. The next morning, Drizzt warily came down out of the mountains, hoping the search was no longer on.  He hoped to reveal himself to the Thistledowns and make his peace with the locals, but when he arrives no one is yet stirring about the farm. Drizzt decides to sit and wait, but when there has been no activity from morning through late afternoon to evening, he began to sense something was amiss. He walks down and into the house, finding the murdered Thistledowns in gruesome display all about the house. Drizzt was shocked with his failure to protect the family, and immediately vowed to avenge their deaths.</p><p>The next morning, Drizzt takes his weapons and Guen and trudges up into the mountains, where all the signs of the murderous creature pointed. As they neared the hiding place of his new enemy, he heard the familiar sound of the running creature that had stung him and stole his scimitar. Not caugh unawares this time, he catches the little beast, a quickling name Tephanis, and forces to tell him who killed the farmers. After giving the name and location of the barghest Ulgulu, the green-skinned little creature stabs Drizzt in the hand to try and get away, but Drizzt ignores the pain, smashes the quickling against a rock, and throws it down into the valley below. He pulls the tiny dagger out of his hand and walks on.</p> At the barghest's cave, he is confronted by two goblins, which he promptly slays and enters the cave. Inside, he finds the two demonic fiends standing inside, and immediately slips into The Hunter. Ulgulu, thinking he's found easy prey and a final meal on the material plane, jumps toward the drow but is stopped in mid-air by Guen. Drizzt turns to attack Kempfana, and is set to hopping to stay out of the huge beast's reach. Ulgulua shapeshifts into a great demon wolf after Guen bites him in the shoulder, and chases Guen from the cave. Kempfana, meanwhile, has caught Drizzt and is holding him up by the neck. When the barghest opens his mouth to bite off Drizzt's head, the dark elf shoves his scimitar through the back of the demon's mouth, impaling his brain. Released, Drizzt rushes out to see Ulgulu trap Guen near the canyon edge. When the demon wolf jumps, Drizzt uses the figurine to send Guen home, causing Ulgulu to miss entirely and plummet to the canyon floor below to certain death.",

    "deck": "Roddy McGristle is a local tracker in Malobar, and holds a deep and somewhat unreasoning grudge against Drizzt Do'urden. He travels with a group tracking Drizzt, and wishes to kill him.",
    "description": "<p>Taking up residence in a small mountain cave, Drizzt spent his days roaming the countryside around a farming community  down in the valley below. He was trying to gather the courage to introduce himself to his neighbors, when he is met by a pack of gnolls, doglike humanoids that are often kept as slaves by drow in the Underdark. This pack sees Drizzt as a friend, owing to the drow reputation for violence and cruelty, and ask him to come along as they go to kill their enemies. Not entirely trusting the creatures, but not wanting to immediately mistrust them, he went along until they came to a farmstead down in the valley near Malobar. When Drizzt asks the gnoll leader's intentions, he is answered with, <b><i>\"Enemies. Kill oldest woman, catch men.\"</i></b> When Drizzt asks, <b><i>\"What of the children?\"</i></b> he is met with the reply, <b><i>\"Dinner.\"</i></b></p><p>Now knowing that the gnolls are evil, and the family below innocent, Drizzt quickly draws his scimitar and slays the leader. He and Guenhwyvar quickly finish off the remaining two, leaving them in puddles of blood. When it was over, Drizzt began to second guess himself. He was new to the surface world. Who was he to judge the gnolls in such a way. Perhaps the humans and gnolls were at war with one another, and the gnolls had had relatives killed by someone in the human family. Drizzt needed time alone to learn more and consider further action. He sends Guen home and begins observing the family. He soon sees that they are a happy family of hard, honest workers. Within three days he is assured he had made the right decision in killing the gnolls. This family was good, and he vowed to protect them to the death.</p> Up in the mountains, much higher than Drizzt's cave home, dwelt two creatures of Gehenna called barghests. Demonic creatures, they were near maturity and had been sent to the material plane to feed on the flesh of humans and grow strong enough to return home. Ulgulua, the older of the two, is informed by one of their servants of the slaying of the gnoll by a drow. In anger, Ulgulu bites the head off the messenger, and conferes with his brother, Kempfana, as to what they should do about a dark elf in their domain. Kempfana suggests that they use the drow as a scapegoat to explain the disappearances that have occurred since they came to the area. Ulgulu decides to investigate and sends his pet quickling, Tephanis, to gather more information.<br/> One day, when the youngest Thistledown child, Liam, shirks his chores and wanders off into the forest, Drizzt follows to ensure his safety. The boy accidentally discovers Drizzt, who, though he was stealthy, was still ignorant of woodlore. Liam runs home and tells his siblings of the dark skinned elf he saw in the woods. Liam convinces his older brother and sister into a ruse to try and flush Drizzt out, and they reluctantly agree. Drizzt, seeing through the ruse easily, decides to play along. When the maiden, Eleni, acts as if she has fallen, Drizzt reveals himself and hopes to make himself known as a friend. Conner, the oldest boy, immediatly recognizes Drizzt as a drow, draws his sword, and races to attack. Though Conner is skilled by local standards, Drizzt easily disarms the boy and offers him his sword back, a drow sign of friendship. Conner and the others panic and run back home as fast as they can. In the bushes, Drizzt has been seen by another set of eyes who are not so friendly.<br/><br/> By the next morning, the entire community of Malobar had heard the rumor of the dark elf. The town's mayor, Bartholomew Delmo sends a request to nearby Sundabar for a ranger to come and help deal with situation. A local huntsman, Roddy McGristle, is skeptical that Conner saw what he says he saw, but volunteers himself to track whatever creature this might be, and organizes a search party on the spot. That afternoon, a body of men were led into the nearby forest by Roddy's bloodhounds, and Drizzt shadowed them easily. He wanted to reveal himself, but understood they would likely see him as an enemy. While lost in his reverie, the quickling Tephanis dashes by, slashing Drizzt's wrist and stealing a scimitar. Drizzt cries out, in surprise more than pain, and is heard by Roddy and his dogs. Calling on Guenhwyvar as a distraction, Drizzt hoped to get away, but the bloodhounds have clearly picked up his scent and catch up to him easily. When one bursts through the brush to attack, Drizzt cuts it down instinctively, and finds himself in a battle with Roddy. Not desiring to hurt the hunter, he dashed and ducked out of the way. Roddy's great battleaxe caught on a nearby tree, cutting in down to fall on top of him, smashing him in the face. Drizzt runs as quickly as he can and loses himself in the forest.<p>Later that night, the barghest Ulgulu comes down off of his mountain carrying the stolen scimitar of Drizzt. All barghests are shape-shifters, and so Ulgulu took on the form of Drizzt and strode into the farmhouse of the Thistledowns. As Conner and his father, Conner Sr., sat discussing the events of the day's hunt, the false drow bursts into their home, slaughtering the entire family. The next morning, Drizzt warily came down out of the mountains, hoping the search was no longer on.  He hoped to reveal himself to the Thistledowns and make his peace with the locals, but when he arrives no one is yet stirring about the farm. Drizzt decides to sit and wait, but when there has been no activity from morning through late afternoon to evening, he began to sense something was amiss. He walks down and into the house, finding the murdered Thistledowns in gruesome display all about the house. Drizzt was shocked with his failure to protect the family, and immediately vowed to avenge their deaths.</p><p>The next morning, Drizzt takes his weapons and Guen and trudges up into the mountains, where all the signs of the murderous creature pointed. As they neared the hiding place of his new enemy, he heard the familiar sound of the running creature that had stung him and stole his scimitar. Not caugh unawares this time, he catches the little beast, a quickling name Tephanis, and forces to tell him who killed the farmers. After giving the name and location of the barghest Ulgulu, the green-skinned little creature stabs Drizzt in the hand to try and get away, but Drizzt ignores the pain, smashes the quickling against a rock, and throws it down into the valley below. He pulls the tiny dagger out of his hand and walks on.</p><br/> At the barghest's cave, he is confronted by two goblins, which he promptly slays and enters the cave. Inside, he finds the two demonic fiends standing inside, and immediately slips into The Hunter. Ulgulu, thinking he's found easy prey and a final meal on the material plane, jumps toward the drow but is stopped in mid-air by Guen. Drizzt turns to attack Kempfana, and is set to hopping to stay out of the huge beast's reach. Ulgulua shapeshifts into a great demon wolf after Guen bites him in the shoulder, and chases Guen from the cave. Kempfana, meanwhile, has caught Drizzt and is holding him up by the neck. When the barghest opens his mouth to bite off Drizzt's head, the dark elf shoves his scimitar through the back of the demon's mouth, impaling his brain. Released, Drizzt rushes out to see Ulgulu trap Guen near the canyon edge. When the demon wolf jumps, Drizzt uses the figurine to send Guen home, causing Ulgulu to miss entirely and plummet to the canyon floor below to certain death.<br/> Back down in the town of Malobar, at the Thistledown farm, the renowned tracker Dove Falconhand has arrived to investigate recent events. Though she has arrived too late to prevent the family's murder, she is determined to track down the perpetrator. Joining Dove are her three most trusted traveling companions, Gabriel, a human warrior, Kellindil, an elven archer, and Fret, a dwarven sage. Having already been informed of the rumors of a dark elf, Dove and her group begin investigating the family farmstead. Pieces do not add up, such as a shattered lock, something beyond the ability of even the strongest elf. The inconsistencies are explained away by the arrival of Roddy McGristle, who blames such thing on the drow's \"big black panther.\"<br/> Though Dove believes that Roddy did indeed see and tangle with a drow, she is mistrustful of his motives. He blames the killing of a beloved dog and his facial scarring on the drow, and is obviously looking for some kind of vengeance. Mayor Delmo tells Dove that they will take McGristle with them because <b><i>\"he's a seasoned hunter and knows this area better than any.\"</i></b> Dove is troubled by the news, but does not argue. Some of Dove's doubts do disappear after Gabriel discovers a shattered scimitar inside the Thistledown home, coated in human blood. Questions still remain, after Kellindil points out two sets of identical elven footprints, made a day apart. But one set is deeper, indicating too massive a weight for an elf's steps. Further, Fret points out a ceiling beam snapped nearly in half, a feat too great for either a drow or a panther.<p>Hiding in the bushes nearby, Drizzt listens to the conversations of those now employed to find them. Though he wished to reveal himself and explain everything that had happened, how it had all been perpetrated by Ulgulu, and how he himself avenged the Thistledown family's deaths, he knew he could not. As soon as the color of his skin was seen, he would be attacked and given no quarter. Returning to his cave, he gathered his things and fled the area surrounding Malobar.</p><p>Dove and her fellow investigators come upon the body of Ulgulu in the canyon, making note of the claw marks all over the creatures body. Kellindil then reports that there is another beast, a red one, and two goblins up above, both killed by scimitar. When Dove asks, <b><i>\"Why would the dark elf kill the barghest?\"</i></b> Fret immediately deduces the correct answer. <b><i>\"Don't you see? Somehow the barghest acquired one fo the scimitars, then, in the shape of the drow, murdered the farmers.\"</i></b> In a rage, Roddy McGristle will hear nothing of the theory, challenging the dwarf to call him a liar. Finding further drow footprints leading away from the canyon, Dove and her crew move onward, her doubts remaining still.</p> Drizzt ran ahead of them, moving day and night, not daring to stop until exhausted. He used every trick he knew to evade them, running through streams and swimming lakes, doubling back on his own tracks, even jumping from tree to tree. Nevertheless, Dove and her crew was too skilled to be evaded, and stayed unerringly on his trail. Dove's own group pushed themselves to exhaustion, not daring to let a drow be loose on the surface world, even if they had their doubts about his guilt. None of them, except for McGristle had ever actually seen a drow, and the last reported sighting of one on the surface had been ten years before. Unknown to the trackers, Drizzt had been a part of that group, saving the life of a small elfin girl while his patrol group massacred the rest of the settlement. Based solely on the reputation of the drow race, they were obligated to track him down and learn his intentions.<p>One night, while encamped, Kellindil notices they are being watched, and shoots his arrow into the brush, hitting Guenhwyvar in the flank. She runs back to Drizzt, who pulls the arrow from her side. <b><i>\"So now we know their intentions,\"</i></b> Drizzt tells her. <b><i>\"How far will you hunt me? We shall see.\"</i></b></p><p>Behind him in the next day's light, Dove is still tracking the dark elf. He was very good, but he made just enough mistakes that they could find clues as to his direction. If his woodcraft had been better, he might have been able to elude them entirely, but being a creature most suited to living underground where foilage was not an issue in tracking, he was at a clear disadvantage. If not for his speed, agiliy, and intelligence, they might have caught him nearly immediately. Drizzt himself gave them the largest advantage by refusing to put greater distance between himself and his pursuers. Each night he would work his way back to a position where he could watch their camp, the arise early enough to get a good head start. In his heart, Drizzt's true wish was to walk out of the shadows, explain everything to them, and ask to be a part of their world. Fear and experience, however, held him back from such a move.</p><br/> It was on one of these nights that he was finally discovered. Kellindil had been patroling the perimeter of the camp, and came up on Drizzt. <b><i>\"At last we have met, my dark cousin,\"</i></b> the light elf told him. At first, Drizzt was glad he had been discovered. He dreamed of sharing his trials and experiences with his light skinned cousin, and professing his hatred of his own race. <b><i>\"My name is—\"</i></b> he began, but was cut off as Kellindil drew a sword, proclaiming, <b><i>\"I don't care what you call yourself!\"</i></b> Kellindil only cared that Drizzt was a drow, and therefore immediately assumed him an evil creature. Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <b><i>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</i></b><br/> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him.<p>When Roddy McGristle announces that they need to hurry before the drow gets away, Dove announces, <b><i>\"We shall pursue the dark elf no longer. He was never our enemy.\"</i></b> When Roddy explodes in exasperated anger against her pronouncement, Dove calmly explains that Gabriel is wounded, Kellindil is nearly out of arrows, and their supplies are nearly gone. Even if she still believed the drow to be a murderer, they would no longer be able to keep on the move without rest and restocking, something impossible in the Northern wilds. Furthermore, Dove states here belief that it was Drizzt who avenged the Thistledowns and slew the barghests. Dove and her men turn to leave, Roddy calling them cowards to their backs as they leave him alone in the bloody canyon.</p> Drizzt stayed on the move. It was soon apparent he was no longer being pursued, but he knew it would not be safe for him to stay in one place. In addition, the season was quickly changing from warm summer to cold winter, especially since he had been constantly moving north. The cold, unknown in the Underdark, was sapping his strength and causing him more difficulty than anything else he had yet encountered. He kept journeying until he came to a mountain pass with a river full of fish and rocky protection against the cold northern wind. He settled down, exposed in the open air, believing the cold could not possibly last long. He was sadly mistaken, having no concept of the turning of the seasons. As night fell, so too did the temperature, and Drizzt desperately worked at trying to start a fire using rock and steel. After many unsuccessful attempts, he was finally able to get a flame going, and Kellindil, who was still silently tracking him, was pleased to see that the drow would survive. Kellindil now decided he would stand watch over this strange drow that had shown him and his friends mercy and compassion when they would not. Unknown to them both, other sets of eyes watched the drow.<p>As days spread into weeks, Drizzt did the best he could to survive, still hoping the cold weather would not get worse. Then the snows began. Drizzt and Guenhwyvar set off in search of shelter, finding a cave. Upon entering, they find a bear just starting to bed down for winter hibernation. Drizzt stared the beast down, somehow finding a sort of unspoken understanding and accomodation. Offering the bear a fresh fish, the bear settled down and allowed the newcomers to share the cave, at least for the time being. Guenhwyvar, unaffected by the cold, foraged daily for the food and wood needed to keep the drow alive. Otherwise, Drizzt sat cold and alone in the cave, despairing as the weather produced more and more snow, and finally ice. Just when he believed he could bear no more, winter broke into spring, and the snows began to melt.</p><br/> News of the dark elf's survival spread throughout the surrounding countryside, pleasing some with the news, but causing fear and trepidation in others. Minions of the Orc Chieftan Graul had seen the drow enter their environs before the snows set in, and Graul had commanded them to set a watch over him, but secretly hoped the snow would drive him away. Since that had not happened, and the dark elf had survived the winter, Graul wondered if this lone drow were a scout for a larger force to come, bringing war with them. If the drow were alone, he might come in and try to usurp leadership of his tribe. Neither situation could be allowed to stand, so he orders his men to go and kill the elf.<br/> They found Drizzt walking through the local forest, enjoying his first spring. He was enamored by the new growth literally springing from the once dead ground. So enamored, in fact, he was caught by surprise by the attacking orcs. Drizzt easily killed the first two attackers, but was taken down by one of their feral wolves, pinned until he could call for Guenhwyvar. Even with the wolf off his back, he was severely disadvantaged, and would have been slain by a third orc if not for the timely intervention of an arrow in the beast's back. All enemies now dead, Drizzt looks up to see an old, green clad human bearing down on him with a great wooden bow. <b><i>\"You're my prisoner,\"</i></b> the newcomer stately matter of factly, to which Drizzt responds, <b><i>\"I think not.\"</i></b> Guen moves in to flank the human, and the man reaches out a hand to the great cat. Guen licks the old man's hand like an old friend.<p>Intrigued with the bearing and intent of Drizzt, the old man introduces himself as the ranger Montolio Debrouchee. Drizzt soon comes to realize that the man is blind, and is amazed that he could function well, let alone fire an arrow accurately in that condition. Montolio warns him that he had killed minions of Graul, something the Orc Chieftan will not allow to go unpunished. Because of his blindness, the orcs believe Montolio is \"bad magic\" and will not approach his castle. He tells Drizzt that coming to live with him is the safest place. Drizzt refuses, saying <b><i>\"You would be better served, Montolio Debrouchee, to keep away from me. I bring trouble.\"</i></b> Even after more prodding and assurances of safety from the old ranger, Drizzt still refuses. So, Montolio leaves Drizzt behind, taking Guenhwyvar with him. It was Guen's trust of the man that changed Drizzt heart. He knew that the great cat's instincts had never been wrong before, and he did not relish the idea of facing an army of orcs on his own.</p> Drizzt follows Montolio to his \"castle,\" which in reality was a grove of massive trees reaching as high as could be seen. Each tree was a living house, whole rooms carved out of the tree's insides, this internal stairway reaching up into the highest regions of the grove. Wood and rope bridges connected the trees to one another, providing not only easy access across the heights, but also numerous positions from which to watch and defend the grove. In his short life, Drizzt had seen dwelling places more fantastic than this, but none more welcoming. Drizzt hoped that he had finally found a place to call home, but worried that something would find him and destroy it, despite the assurances of Montolio.<p>A week later, Kellindil is informed by a cousin of Drizzt's arrival in Montolio's grove. He is shocked at first to learn of the budding relationship between the drow and the ranger, but is now satisfied of Drizzt's friendly intentions. If Montlio trusted the drow, then he need no longer worry about the goodness of the dark elf's heart. In the bushes, yet another interested party has heard the news. Tephanis the quickling remembered the name Drizzt very well, for the dark elf had thrown the the little man to his death just months before. When he had recovered, he had found his former master, Ulgulu, dead at the bottom of the crevasse where he had fallen. Eventually, Tephanis found a new ally, Caroak, the Winter Wolf.</p><p>When summer came, an unwanted visitor arrived, bringing all his usual bluster and lying with him, Roddy McGristle. He demanded to know from the ranger if he had seen the drow, or knew where he might be found. In addition, his lies about the dark elf continued to grow more extreme, reporting to Montolio that Drizzt had not only killed the Thistledown family, but that Guenhwyvar had also eaten one of them. Montolio lies and tells him he had heard the drow went to a place called Morueme's Cave, a place 150 miles in the opposite direction through treacherous terrain. After the evil man was gone, Drizzt came and pleaded his innocence to Montolio, something which the old ranger already knew, having spoken to Dove Falconhand, who had not only told of his innocence, but of his rescue of her and her men.</p> During all this time, Roddy McGristle had trudged halfway to the Nethers before he realized he had been duped. He finally determined that the ranger was trying to protect and hide the drow. Knowing he could not take on the ranger and drow alone, he turned and looked for allies, even such creatures he would normally never have contact with, Graul the Orc Chieftain. Roddy knew that Graul's minions had been unable to find the drow, so Roddy  informed them he was with the ranger, and that they were plotting together against the orcs. A consummate liar, Roddy went on to convine the Orc Chieftain that they were planning on rousing all the elves, and dwarves, and forest animals against the orc tribe. This roused the ire of Graul, who then decides to muster his forces and attack the grove. At that moment, Tephanis and Caroak stride into the cave, promising to rouse the worgs against the ranger and his grove. The war was about to be joined. Hooter, having spied the preparations for the orc and worgs, flies back and tells Montolio of all he has seen. War is finally coming to the grove, a war which Montonlio had been prepared for for years.<p>Graul, Caroak, and Roddy were quickly successful in amassing a fairly large force in a short time, a group consisting of a hundred orc warriors, a few giants, and a dozen wargs. Together, they set out down the crags and crevasses of the high peaks and moved methodically toward the grove of Montolio below. In that very same grove, Montolio explained to Drizzt how he had known this night would come, expeciting it for five years. He had played out every possible scenario in his mind, and had stockpiled the necessary weapons and supplies to defend the grove all on his own. He now felt he had a greater advantage with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar at his side. So they began to prepare for the battle, readying weapons, calling in animal allies, and setting traps until all they could do was wait. They did not have long to rest.</p><p>From behind his seemingly overwhelming force, Graul calls for the attack. Orcs and wargs stream toward the grove, looking to tear apart any living thing they met, whether sentient being or plant. From high above on the rope bridges, Drizzt ran from crossbow to crossbow, each of which was already loaded with large bolts, and began firing into the crowd with deadly accuracy. He made every shot count, not daring to miss and lose any slight advantage over the attacking hoard. Montolio, hiding in the shadows, used the grunts and clanking armor to give him targets, their loudness creating beacon bright targets for the blind man. The bear Drizzt had bedded down with during his first winter, and other animals came out of the woods and slew orc after orc, quickly thinning the number of enemies against the grove's protectors.</p><br/> While the battle is raging at the front entrance to the grove, Caroak and his wargs were sneaking into the grove through the thick growth behind the defenders. Their plan was to come up on them from behind and tear them apart, but little did they know the rear was guarded by the most silent, and possibly most deadly of the grove's defenders, Guenhwyvar. The black panther jumps on the winter wolf, and at first they seem evenly matched, Guen easily evades the freezing breath of the wolf and goes for the jugular. Caroak the Great Winter Wolf is dead, and the remaining wargs flee in terror.<br/> When Drizzt gets to his last arrow, he finally sees McGristle in the fray below him. While he wanted to put his personal grief at an end by killing the lying hunter, he also spied the Orc Chieftain Graul next to him, and he reasoned that killing Graul would end the attack for good. His choice made, he fired at the orc, but Roddy noticed the arrow at the last moment and pushed the orc out of the way. Drizzt's final shot had been wasted. All the traps have been sprung, and both Montolio and the drow were out of arrows, so they drew their swords and leaped headlong into the remaining enemies. Whether orc, warg or giant, the two rangers were more than a match for their enemies, leaving no recourse but to run from the grove as fast as their feet would carry them. Even after all this, Roddy prodded Graul to go in himself and fight back, believing the two of them were more than a match for the rangers. Graul knew his men would follow him if he led another charge, but the Orc Chieftain was not one to risk his own life. He bashed Roddy upside the head, knocking him unconscious, and ran for his life. The battle was over.<p>Hours later, when Roddy awoke, Tephanis found him and convinced him that not only was the battle over, but that Drizzt had been killed by a warg. Believing the tale, Roddy felt his vengeance was satisfied, but was disappointed he had not killed the dark elf himself. They left the grove, Tephanis taking Roddy as his new master.</p><p>Over the next six years, Drizzt traveled from village to village, town to town, hoping the next one might take him in. His reception was always met with fear and prejudice which always turned to anger. Many times the dark elf had to defend himself against senseless violence towards him. Even after so many rejections, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar pressed on, believing in his heart that he would one day find acceptance, and with it a home. Unknown to Drizzt, however, his presence did not go unnoticed, making his passing the talk of the local taverns all over the region. In one such tavern, Roddy McGristle overheard the rumors, and learned of a purple-eyed drow moving from town to town. In a rage, he confronted Tephanis with his lie about the death of Drizzt, and killed the quickling for his treachery. The vengeful hunter set out on the road to find the drow once again.</p> Drizzt found himself on the road yet again, heading north towards the Spine of the World mountain range in the northwestern corner of Faerun. Skirting the narrow passage of land between the mountain range and the coast, he eventually made his way into the wide valley known as Icewind Dale. Originally settled by rogues with no where else to go centuries before, the Dale now boasted ten villages, collectively known as Ten-Towns. Each of the ten villages made their livelihood through fishing for the knucklehead trout which lived in abundance in the several lakes of the Dale. Good for food, the knucklehead troat was also the sole source of bone for the Dale's other well-known export, scrimshaw.       When he approaches the gates, the guards halt him as they would any other newcomer. After they discover he is a drow, they panic and one of them runs to get the town's spokesman. Cassius is not only the spokesman for the town of Bryn Shander, but he is also the principle spokesman of the Ten-Towns ruling council, making him the most powerful man in the Dale.  He questions why Drizzt has come to their town, and then refuses Drizzt admittance, telling him to try one of the other, smaller towns. <b><i>\"And when they refuse me entry where then, fair spokesman?\"</i></b> Drizzt asks plainly. <b><i>\"Out in the wind to die on the empty plain?\"</i></b> After asking if Drizzt is good with his blades, he tells Drizzt that <b><i>\"It would do Ten-Towns well to have a scout on the mountain's (Kelvin's Cairn) northern slopes.\"</i></b> When Drizzt balks a bit at the offer, seeing it as only a way to get rid of the drow, Cassius replies, <b><i>\"I offer you a hole in a plie of rock where your actions, good or bad, will become your reputation beyond the color of your skin. I offer you a chance to prove yourself worthy of a place here. I can do no more than that.\"</i></b> To this, Drizzt agrees and accepts, trading his horse for supplies and making his way toward Kelvin's Cairn within the hour.<p>A few weeks later, Drizzt's enemy, Roddy McGristle enters Icewind Dale. Somehow, he had been able to track Drizzt from Lurkwood all the way to Bryn Shander. From there, he was able to follow the clues to the throne room of Clan Battlehammer. Bruenor, still not  believing he had encountered a drow, says he had not seen a dark elf. In addition, he states that, <b><i>\"If yer drow's about, he's been no bother.\"</i></b> McGristle goes into his usual diatribe about how Drizzt attacked and killed the Thistledown family, killed one of his dogs, and scarred his face. To these accusations, Cattie-Brie calls McGristle a liar, and then Bruenor throws the ugly human out of his Hall for upsetting his daughter. After Roddy is gone,  Bruenor turns on his daughter and yells, <b><i>\"Ye've been to the mountain and seen the drow, haven't ye? Ye've disobeyed me! And now we learn the dark elf's a killer!\"</i></b></p><p>Disbeleiving the accusations, Cattie-Brie runs out into the winter snows to confront Drizzt, and tells him of Roddy and the rumors of the Thistledown family. <b><i>\"So that story has followed me event to the end of the world.\"</i></b> Drizzt is shocked, but not surprised, and as they discuss the situation further, Drizzt realizes that his troubles will not soon end. He sends Cattie-Brie home, telling her not to fear for his own safety. At that moment, Drizzt decides he has no wish to further battle Roddy, and so decides to leave Icewind Dale. As Cattie is headed home, she is assaulted by Roddy, who has followed her and seen her with Drizzt. He threatens her and tells her she will take him to Drizzt, but he drow appears behind him suddenly and says, <b><i>\"Let the girl go, McGristle.\"</i></b> After a brief, but heated exchange, Roddy lets Cattie go, and attacks Drizzt. Easily evading the brutish attack, Drizzt succeeds in knocking the hunter down, and has the man at his mercy. Instead of choosing to strike the bigot down, he slams his scimitar's pommels against Roddy's temples, knocking him unconscious. Drizzt leaves him lying in the snow. Hours later, Cattie-Brie brings Bruenor to where Roddy lay. He tells Roddy that he should not have touched Cattie, and furthermore should not caller her a liar. He takes a leg from the hunter's remaining dog as revenge. McGristle and his now three legged dog left the Dale and never returned, neither did he ever bother Drizzt again.</p>",

    "deck": "Dove Falconhand is one the the Seven Sisters, and a resident of Sundabar. She is a renouned tracker and warrior who is called upon to track Drizzt Do'urden in the area around Malobar.",
    "description": "<p>Dove Falconhand arrives in Malobar to investigate recent murder of the Thistledown family. Though she has arrived too late to prevent the family's murder, she is determined to track down the perpetrator. Joining Dove are her three most trusted traveling companions, Gabriel, a human warrior, Kellindil, an elven archer, and Fret, a dwarven sage. Having already been informed of the rumors of a dark elf, Dove and her group begin investigating the family farmstead. Pieces do not add up, such as a shattered lock, something beyond the ability of even the strongest elf. The inconsistencies are explained away by the arrival of Roddy McGristle, who blames such thing on the drow's \"big black panther.\"       Though Dove believes that Roddy did indeed see and tangle with a drow, she is mistrustful of his motives. He blames the killing of a beloved dog and his facial scarring on the drow, and is obviously looking for some kind of vengeance. Mayor Delmo tells Dove that they will take McGristle with them because <b><i>\"he's a seasoned hunter and knows this area better than any.\"</i></b> Dove is troubled by the news, but does not argue. Some of Dove's doubts do disappear after Gabriel discovers a shattered scimitar inside the Thistledown home, coated in human blood. Questions still remain, after Kellindil points out two sets of identical elven footprints, made a day apart. But one set is deeper, indicating too massive a weight for an elf's steps. Further, Fret points out a ceiling beam snapped nearly in half, a feat too great for either a drow or a panther.</p><p>Dove and her fellow investigators come upon the body of Ulgulu in the canyon, making note of the claw marks all over the creatures body. Kellindil then reports that there is another beast, a red one, and two goblins up above, both killed by scimitar. When Dove asks, <b><i>\"Why would the dark elf kill the barghest?\"</i></b> Fret immediately deduces the correct answer. <b><i>\"Don't you see? Somehow the barghest acquired one fo the scimitars, then, in the shape of the drow, murdered the farmers.\"</i></b> In a rage, Roddy McGristle will hear nothing of the theory, challenging the dwarf to call him a liar. Finding further drow footprints leading away from the canyon, Dove and her crew move onward, her doubts remaining still.</p> Drizzt ran ahead of them, moving day and night, not daring to stop until exhausted. He used every trick he knew to evade them, running through streams and swimming lakes, doubling back on his own tracks, even jumping from tree to tree. Nevertheless, Dove and her crew was too skilled to be evaded, and stayed unerringly on his trail. Dove's own group pushed themselves to exhaustion, not daring to let a drow be loose on the surface world, even if they had their doubts about his guilt. None of them, except for McGristle had ever actually seen a drow, and the last reported sighting of one on the surface had been ten years before. Unknown to the trackers, Drizzt had been a part of that group, saving the life of a small elfin girl while his patrol group massacred the rest of the settlement. Based solely on the reputation of the drow race, they were obligated to track him down and learn his intentions.<p>One night, while encamped, Kellindil notices they are being watched, and shoots his arrow into the brush, hitting Guenhwyvar in the flank. She runs back to Drizzt, who pulls the arrow from her side. <b><i>\"So now we know their intentions,\"</i></b> Drizzt tells her. <b><i>\"How far will you hunt me? We shall see.\"</i></b></p><p>Behind him in the next day's light, Dove is still tracking the dark elf. He was very good, but he made just enough mistakes that they could find clues as to his direction. If his woodcraft had been better, he might have been able to elude them entirely, but being a creature most suited to living underground where foilage was not an issue in tracking, he was at a clear disadvantage. If not for his speed, agiliy, and intelligence, they might have caught him nearly immediately. Drizzt himself gave them the largest advantage by refusing to put greater distance between himself and his pursuers. Each night he would work his way back to a position where he could watch their camp, the arise early enough to get a good head start. In his heart, Drizzt's true wish was to walk out of the shadows, explain everything to them, and ask to be a part of their world. Fear and experience, however, held him back from such a move.</p> It was on one of these nights that he was finally discovered. Kellindil had been patroling the perimeter of the camp, and came up on Drizzt. <b><i>\"At last we have met, my dark cousin,\"</i></b> the light elf told him. At first, Drizzt was glad he had been discovered. He dreamed of sharing his trials and experiences with his light skinned cousin, and professing his hatred of his own race. <b><i>\"My name is—\"</i></b> he began, but was cut off as Kellindil drew a sword, proclaiming, <b><i>\"I don't care what you call yourself!\"</i></b> Kellindil only cared that Drizzt was a drow, and therefore immediately assumed him an evil creature. Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <b><i>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</i></b> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him.<p>When Roddy McGristle announces that they need to hurry before the drow gets away, Dove announces, <b><i>\"We shall pursue the dark elf no longer. He was never our enemy.\"</i></b> When Roddy explodes in exasperated anger against her pronouncement, Dove calmly explains that Gabriel is wounded, Kellindil is nearly out of arrows, and their supplies are nearly gone. Even if she still believed the drow to be a murderer, they would no longer be able to keep on the move without rest and restocking, something impossible in the Northern wilds. Furthermore, Dove states here belief that it was Drizzt who avenged the Thistledowns and slew the barghests. Dove and her men turn to leave, Roddy calling them cowards to their backs as they leave him alone in the bloody canyon.</p>",

    "deck": "Gabriel is a human warrior and companion of Dove Falconhand. He is among the group called upon to track and capture the renegade drow Drizzt Do'urden.",
    "description": "<p>Dove Falconhand arrives in Malobar to investigate recent murder of the Thistledown family. Though she has arrived too late to prevent the family's murder, she is determined to track down the perpetrator. Joining Dove are her three most trusted traveling companions, Gabriel, a human warrior, Kellindil, an elven archer, and Fret, a dwarven sage. Having already been informed of the rumors of a dark elf, Dove and her group begin investigating the family farmstead. Pieces do not add up, such as a shattered lock, something beyond the ability of even the strongest elf. The inconsistencies are explained away by the arrival of Roddy McGristle, who blames such thing on the drow's \"big black panther.\"       Though Dove believes that Roddy did indeed see and tangle with a drow, she is mistrustful of his motives. He blames the killing of a beloved dog and his facial scarring on the drow, and is obviously looking for some kind of vengeance. Mayor Delmo tells Dove that they will take McGristle with them because <b><i>\"he's a seasoned hunter and knows this area better than any.\"</i></b> Dove is troubled by the news, but does not argue. Some of Dove's doubts do disappear after Gabriel discovers a shattered scimitar inside the Thistledown home, coated in human blood. Questions still remain, after Kellindil points out two sets of identical elven footprints, made a day apart. But one set is deeper, indicating too massive a weight for an elf's steps. Further, Fret points out a ceiling beam snapped nearly in half, a feat too great for either a drow or a panther.</p><p>Dove and her fellow investigators come upon the body of Ulgulu in the canyon, making note of the claw marks all over the creatures body. Kellindil then reports that there is another beast, a red one, and two goblins up above, both killed by scimitar. When Dove asks, <b><i>\"Why would the dark elf kill the barghest?\"</i></b> Fret immediately deduces the correct answer. <b><i>\"Don't you see? Somehow the barghest acquired one fo the scimitars, then, in the shape of the drow, murdered the farmers.\"</i></b> In a rage, Roddy McGristle will hear nothing of the theory, challenging the dwarf to call him a liar. Finding further drow footprints leading away from the canyon, Dove and her crew move onward, her doubts remaining still.</p> Drizzt ran ahead of them, moving day and night, not daring to stop until exhausted. He used every trick he knew to evade them, running through streams and swimming lakes, doubling back on his own tracks, even jumping from tree to tree. Nevertheless, Dove and her crew was too skilled to be evaded, and stayed unerringly on his trail. Dove's own group pushed themselves to exhaustion, not daring to let a drow be loose on the surface world, even if they had their doubts about his guilt. None of them, except for McGristle had ever actually seen a drow, and the last reported sighting of one on the surface had been ten years before. Unknown to the trackers, Drizzt had been a part of that group, saving the life of a small elfin girl while his patrol group massacred the rest of the settlement. Based solely on the reputation of the drow race, they were obligated to track him down and learn his intentions.<p>One night, while encamped, Kellindil notices they are being watched, and shoots his arrow into the brush, hitting Guenhwyvar in the flank. She runs back to Drizzt, who pulls the arrow from her side. <b><i>\"So now we know their intentions,\"</i></b> Drizzt tells her. <b><i>\"How far will you hunt me? We shall see.\"</i></b></p><p>Behind him in the next day's light, Dove is still tracking the dark elf. He was very good, but he made just enough mistakes that they could find clues as to his direction. If his woodcraft had been better, he might have been able to elude them entirely, but being a creature most suited to living underground where foilage was not an issue in tracking, he was at a clear disadvantage. If not for his speed, agiliy, and intelligence, they might have caught him nearly immediately. Drizzt himself gave them the largest advantage by refusing to put greater distance between himself and his pursuers. Each night he would work his way back to a position where he could watch their camp, the arise early enough to get a good head start. In his heart, Drizzt's true wish was to walk out of the shadows, explain everything to them, and ask to be a part of their world. Fear and experience, however, held him back from such a move.</p> It was on one of these nights that he was finally discovered. Kellindil had been patroling the perimeter of the camp, and came up on Drizzt. <b><i>\"At last we have met, my dark cousin,\"</i></b> the light elf told him. At first, Drizzt was glad he had been discovered. He dreamed of sharing his trials and experiences with his light skinned cousin, and professing his hatred of his own race. <b><i>\"My name is—\"</i></b> he began, but was cut off as Kellindil drew a sword, proclaiming, <b><i>\"I don't care what you call yourself!\"</i></b> Kellindil only cared that Drizzt was a drow, and therefore immediately assumed him an evil creature. Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <b><i>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</i></b> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him.<p>When Roddy McGristle announces that they need to hurry before the drow gets away, Dove announces, <b><i>\"We shall pursue the dark elf no longer. He was never our enemy.\"</i></b> When Roddy explodes in exasperated anger against her pronouncement, Dove calmly explains that Gabriel is wounded, Kellindil is nearly out of arrows, and their supplies are nearly gone. Even if she still believed the drow to be a murderer, they would no longer be able to keep on the move without rest and restocking, something impossible in the Northern wilds. Furthermore, Dove states here belief that it was Drizzt who avenged the Thistledowns and slew the barghests. Dove and her men turn to leave, Roddy calling them cowards to their backs as they leave him alone in the bloody canyon.</p>",

Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <b><i>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</i></b> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him.<p>When Roddy McGristle announces that they need to hurry before the drow gets away, Dove announces, <b><i>\"We shall pursue the dark elf no longer. He was never our enemy.\"</i></b> When Roddy explodes in exasperated anger against her pronouncement, Dove calmly explains that Gabriel is wounded, Kellindil is nearly out of arrows, and their supplies are nearly gone. Even if she still believed the drow to be a murderer, they would no longer be able to keep on the move without rest and restocking, something impossible in the Northern wilds. Furthermore, Dove states here belief that it was Drizzt who avenged the Thistledowns and slew the barghests. Dove and her men turn to leave, Roddy calling them cowards to their backs as they leave him alone in the bloody canyon.</p> Drizzt stayed on the move. It was soon apparent he was no longer being pursued, but he knew it would not be safe for him to stay in one place. In addition, the season was quickly changing from warm summer to cold winter, especially since he had been constantly moving north. The cold, unknown in the Underdark, was sapping his strength and causing him more difficulty than anything else he had yet encountered. He kept journeying until he came to a mountain pass with a river full of fish and rocky protection against the cold northern wind. He settled down, exposed in the open air, believing the cold could not possibly last long. He was sadly mistaken, having no concept of the turning of the seasons. As night fell, so too did the temperature, and Drizzt desperately worked at trying to start a fire using rock and steel. After many unsuccessful attempts, he was finally able to get a flame going, and Kellindil, who was still silently tracking him, was pleased to see that the drow would survive. Kellindil now decided he would stand watch over this strange drow that had shown him and his friends mercy and compassion when they would not. Unknown to them both, other sets of eyes watched the drow.       Drizzt eventually meets Montolio Debrouchee, the ranger, and accepts his invitation to live in his grove. In his short life, Drizzt had seen dwelling places more fantastic than this, but none more welcoming. Drizzt hoped that he had finally found a place to call home, but worried that something would find him and destroy it, despite the assurances of Montolio.<p>A week later, Kellindil is informed by a cousin of Drizzt's arrival in Montolio's grove. He is shocked at first to learn of the budding relationship between the drow and the ranger, but is now satisfied of Drizzt's friendly intentions. If Montlio trusted the drow, then he need no longer worry about the goodness of the dark elf's heart.</p>",

    "deck": "Fret is a dwarven sage and companion of Dove Falconhand. He is among the group called upon to track and capture the renegade drow Drizzt Do'urden.",
    "description": "<p>Dove Falconhand arrives in Malobar to investigate recent murder of the Thistledown family. Though she has arrived too late to prevent the family's murder, she is determined to track down the perpetrator. Joining Dove are her three most trusted traveling companions, Gabriel, a human warrior, Kellindil, an elven archer, and Fret, a dwarven sage. Having already been informed of the rumors of a dark elf, Dove and her group begin investigating the family farmstead. Pieces do not add up, such as a shattered lock, something beyond the ability of even the strongest elf. The inconsistencies are explained away by the arrival of Roddy McGristle, who blames such thing on the drow's \"big black panther.\"       Though Dove believes that Roddy did indeed see and tangle with a drow, she is mistrustful of his motives. He blames the killing of a beloved dog and his facial scarring on the drow, and is obviously looking for some kind of vengeance. Mayor Delmo tells Dove that they will take McGristle with them because <b><i>\"he's a seasoned hunter and knows this area better than any.\"</i></b> Dove is troubled by the news, but does not argue. Some of Dove's doubts do disappear after Gabriel discovers a shattered scimitar inside the Thistledown home, coated in human blood. Questions still remain, after Kellindil points out two sets of identical elven footprints, made a day apart. But one set is deeper, indicating too massive a weight for an elf's steps. Further, Fret points out a ceiling beam snapped nearly in half, a feat too great for either a drow or a panther.</p><p>Dove and her fellow investigators come upon the body of Ulgulu in the canyon, making note of the claw marks all over the creatures body. Kellindil then reports that there is another beast, a red one, and two goblins up above, both killed by scimitar. When Dove asks, <b><i>\"Why would the dark elf kill the barghest?\"</i></b> Fret immediately deduces the correct answer. <b><i>\"Don't you see? Somehow the barghest acquired one fo the scimitars, then, in the shape of the drow, murdered the farmers.\"</i></b> In a rage, Roddy McGristle will hear nothing of the theory, challenging the dwarf to call him a liar. Finding further drow footprints leading away from the canyon, Dove and her crew move onward, her doubts remaining still.</p> Drizzt ran ahead of them, moving day and night, not daring to stop until exhausted. He used every trick he knew to evade them, running through streams and swimming lakes, doubling back on his own tracks, even jumping from tree to tree. Nevertheless, Dove and her crew was too skilled to be evaded, and stayed unerringly on his trail. Dove's own group pushed themselves to exhaustion, not daring to let a drow be loose on the surface world, even if they had their doubts about his guilt. None of them, except for McGristle had ever actually seen a drow, and the last reported sighting of one on the surface had been ten years before. Unknown to the trackers, Drizzt had been a part of that group, saving the life of a small elfin girl while his patrol group massacred the rest of the settlement. Based solely on the reputation of the drow race, they were obligated to track him down and learn his intentions.<p>One night, while encamped, Kellindil notices they are being watched, and shoots his arrow into the brush, hitting Guenhwyvar in the flank. She runs back to Drizzt, who pulls the arrow from her side. <b><i>\"So now we know their intentions,\"</i></b> Drizzt tells her. <b><i>\"How far will you hunt me? We shall see.\"</i></b></p><p>Behind him in the next day's light, Dove is still tracking the dark elf. He was very good, but he made just enough mistakes that they could find clues as to his direction. If his woodcraft had been better, he might have been able to elude them entirely, but being a creature most suited to living underground where foilage was not an issue in tracking, he was at a clear disadvantage. If not for his speed, agiliy, and intelligence, they might have caught him nearly immediately. Drizzt himself gave them the largest advantage by refusing to put greater distance between himself and his pursuers. Each night he would work his way back to a position where he could watch their camp, the arise early enough to get a good head start. In his heart, Drizzt's true wish was to walk out of the shadows, explain everything to them, and ask to be a part of their world. Fear and experience, however, held him back from such a move.</p> It was on one of these nights that he was finally discovered. Kellindil had been patroling the perimeter of the camp, and came up on Drizzt. <b><i>\"At last we have met, my dark cousin,\"</i></b> the light elf told him. At first, Drizzt was glad he had been discovered. He dreamed of sharing his trials and experiences with his light skinned cousin, and professing his hatred of his own race. <b><i>\"My name is—\"</i></b> he began, but was cut off as Kellindil drew a sword, proclaiming, <b><i>\"I don't care what you call yourself!\"</i></b> Kellindil only cared that Drizzt was a drow, and therefore immediately assumed him an evil creature. Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <b><i>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</i></b> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side.

    "deck": "Peter Löwenbräu Griffin, Sr is the lead character of the American animated show Family Guy. With Irish descent, Peter is obese, unintelligent and obnoxious. He lives in Quahog, Rhode Island and is married to Lois Pewterschmidt with three children, Chris, Stewie and Meg Griffin.",
    "description": "<p>Peter is from Quahog, Rhode Island with a thick accent. He first appeared in the FOX series \"Family Guy\". His parents are Francis and Thelma Griffin, however his biological father is Mickey McFinnegan . Peter's adoptive father is a very religious man, often bothering Peter and his family in their sinful ways, whilst his biological father is a drunken village idiot from the beer stained streets of Ireland. Peter met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43709\" href=\"/lois-griffin/4005-43709/\">Lois</a> working as a pool boy. Lois' father rejected Peter as he was not a high enough class citizen to date his daughter.</p> <p>He worked as a toy assembly man in Happy-go-Lucky toy factory until Mr. Weed, the CEO, died from choking on a dinner roll while eating dinner at Peter's house. The plant was soon destroyed to make room for a tobacco company, in which Peter became the head of, and then he went out to be a spokesmen for the company. He gave up the position after his son, a highly intelligent, talking baby with dreams of global domination, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43708\" href=\"/stewie-griffin/4005-43708/\">Stewie</a> became addicted to cigarettes.</p> <p>Peter once went under cover to stop a drug scandal at his outcast <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43707\" href=\"/meg-griffin/4005-43707/\">daughter</a>, Meg's school. He pretended to be a new, hot-rod guy that got all the girls and was extremely popular. He managed to get the whole school to burst into song and dance, and got them to stop licking the toads that were giving the hallucinating effect. He later staged his own death. </p><p>In one of the newest episodes, he applies for medical tests after the mentally challenged horse he bought wreaked the local horse racing track.  Here he gets injected with the 'gay gene' which temporarily turns him gay.  The gene wore off when he was in the middle of sleeping with 10 other gay men.  <br /><br />In another episode, his father Francis dies during Meg's 17th birthday party when Peter accidentally fell on him. Guilt-ridden, Peter swears off drinking since he was drunk when his dad died. He then went to see a therapist where during a mental flashback discovered that Francis wasn't really his father. His mother then told him his real father is Flinty Mcfinigan, a peter look-a-like from Ireland who is also the town drunk which down there makes him the most popular townsman around. Flinty also rejects Peter as his son, but later accepts him as his own son after peter beats him in a drink-off. <br /> <br /></p> <h3>Jobs</h3> <br />Peter Griffin has been known to have a large number of jobs. Most of these are only shown in cutaway gags like being a nanny in which he falls on the two children he was hired to take care of, and in the comics a suicide hot line relief person in which he accidentally talks the girl into killing herself.  His first job that we know of was when he was working at the Happy Go Lucky Toy Factory. He lasted in this job for quite a while even after being fired many times for many reasons. He got laid off of this job after he invited his boss Mr. Weed to his house for dinner. Mr. Weed then choked on a dinner roll thus killing him, and during the reading of the will the building was torn down.At one time he was also a jouster at the local renaissance fair but soon quit. One of his longest jobs was when he was a fisherman with his boat \"S.S. more powerful than Superman,Batman,Spiderman, and the Incredible Hulk put together.\". He also had help from two Portuguese immigrants Santos and Pasquale. He ended this job after his boat was destroyed. He now works at the Pawtucket Brewery. He was demoted from being a beer inspector after he got drunk in a matter of minutes and now works forks for a mentally handicapped man named Opie. He now mostly does paperwork.<h2>Personality</h2> <p>Peter Griffin can be mean and kind of uneducated because the I.Q. test he took told him that he was under mentally retarded. He enjoys going to the Upmarket Tailors and farting in the suits. Most of his time he is watching TV. Peter is a big fan of the band, KISS. Whenever he starts a problem, he always wants to solve it, even though he usually ends up causing a bigger problem.  His mortal enemy is Ernie, a giant yellow chicken who once gave Peter a bad coupon.  Their meetings always result in an all-out rumble usually wreaking vast areas of Quahog. Peter always comes out on top, but the chicken always comes back angrier then ever. They apparently worked it out, but it unknown if this friendship will last.<br /></p><h3>Health</h3> <p>Peter Griffin as we all know is overweight, a very heavy drinker and always getting in painful accidents. In the show Peter always regains his health back from injuries.</p> <p>Peter has even been seen doing drugs I.E. Pot, Crack Cocaine, LSD, and Ecstasy. <br />  </p><h3><b>Money</b></h3>Although it is shown sometimes to make very little money, he is able to afford his own zeplin which he called the Hinden Peter and a helicopter he named the Peter Copter. <br /><h3>Relationships</h3><br />Peter has been shown to have mixed relationships with 2 of his 3 kids. He normally comes out showing that he hates Meg such as in one gag when she says hi to him he shoots her. In one episode he is shown to get along very well with Stewie since they both enjoy seeing Lois in pain but this relationship has not gone farther than that. He is also shown to have a somewhat good relationship with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43706\" href=\"/chris-griffin/4005-43706/\">Chris</a> since both of them are idiots even though Chris said in one episode that Peter was the worst father ever. While he has been shown causing his children pain it is shown that he cares very deeply for them. In a recent episode when they though the world was ending, Peter told Lois that he hated the kids which they happened to hear. He later bought them a X Box 360 to make up for it.",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Thaddeus Bach was a promising Peacekeeper. He soon moved up to the ranks of Eidolon Elite. He caught the attention of Quartermaster Temple and was recruited into the Wraith. The Wraith was the embodiment of the Eidolon. Only the best of the best were able to join the Wraith. They take on the most dangerous missions that no one else is capable of. This concerned Thaddeus' pregnant wife, <a href=\"/elua-bach/4005-50058/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50058\">Elua Bach</a>.</p><p>On a mission to meet a weapon dealers. Temple decided to kill him and take his weapons and money. Thaddeus had a severe problem with this. Even though the dealer was a bad alien, they had trials and procedure. Tower told him the Psi-judges aren't perfect and it's their jobs to punish those who are evil. He tells Thaddeus that all he needs from him is five cycles and then he could retire from the Wraith.</p><p>That night, while Elua is sleeping, Thaddeus wakes her and says they need to leave, now. Unfortunately, there were a couple Wraith members were in his home cloaked with invisibility tech. He is knocked out from behind.</p><p>Later, Thaddeus wakes with Temple telling him how disappointed he was. He also finds out that his wife and unborn son were brutally killed. Thaddeus snaps and attacks them all. Out manned and out gunned, he is shot. He is beaten some more, and then left on The Ghost Planet (a barren planet with no civilization). Later, Temple announces that Officer Bach was killed in the line of duty along with his wife and unborn child.</p><p>Thaddeus is saved by an alien named Salomon. After over a month, Salomon revealed to Thaddeus a secret he'd been keeping from him. He said he was only going to share it with him because he knew he was a good man. He tells him how he was born into war and also created weapons. It was the creation of these weapons that killed everyone on his planet while he hid in shame and cowardice. When Thaddeus sees a ship, he asks if it works. Salomon can see the lust for revenge in his eyes and pleads for him to not follow that path. Donning the power bands Salomon created and wearing a hood and cape, Space Ghost is born.</p><p>Space Ghost goes after the members of the Wraith, but is soon faced by an invasion of Zorathians led by the evil <a href=\"/zorak/4005-50059/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50059\">Zorak</a>. While fighting Zorak, he rescues Jan and Jayce and adopts them. Things get out of hand when Quartermaster Temple makes an alliance with Zorak. Space Ghost also realizes that revenge will not bring his wife and unborn child back. He defeats Zorak. The surviving members of the Wraith are arrested along with Temple and Zorak. While Space Ghost's former superiors sort out the corruption scandal that results, Space Ghost goes off with his new sidekicks to fight evil. Meanwhile, Zorak swears revenge.</p><p><i>more to come...</i></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Space Ghost is a highly trained Peacekeeper. He has had extensive training in weapon use and hand-to-hand combat. He also has advanced alien technology, including his power bands that give him an edge over those that oppose him. The power bands each have three buttons. Using them in different combinations, Space Ghost is able to deploy different types of blast power. The bands are capable of emitting stun rays, heat rays, freeze rays, and can even produce a force field to protect him. Space Ghost also has an Inviso-Belt that members of the Wraith had used. When using the Inviso-Belt, he is able to become invisible as well as phase through walls and objects.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/space-ghost/17-31050/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Space Ghost</a> (1966-1968)</p><p>This is where Space Ghost started.

    "deck": "He was 98 pounds of solid nerd... until he became The Toxic Avenger! Melvin Junko is from the toxic crime infested town Tromaville, New Jersey. He's the toughest S.O.B. to ever wear a tutu!",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Melvin Junko, also known as Melvin \"the Mop Boy\" worked at the <a href=\"/tromaville/4020-56870/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56870\">Tromaville</a> center for fitness as a janitor. Scrawny, Weak, Ugly, and somewhat slow, Melvin was always the butt of cruel jokes and mean spirited pranks. Particularly from an unruly group of four seriously troubled punks named Bozo, Slug, Wanda, and Julie. They torture poor Melvin daily, both mentally and physically. Everyday their pranks elevate to a slightly more violent level. Julie eventually comes to Melvin in private proclaiming that she is fed up with Bozo's disgusting behavior and that she wants a more sensitive and caring boyfriend, and that she has always thought that Melvin was cute. She tells him that her favorite color is pink, and that she will only make out with him if he is wearing pink. This causes Melvin to protest that pink is a \"Sissy\" color, but ultimately he ends up putting on a pink ballerina outfit complete with a fluffy pink tutu. She then proceeds to entice him, and convince him to meet her in the pool area in the dark. Melvin finds his way to through the dark to what he believes is Julie, only to have the lights turned on and it is revealed that he has been kissing a sheep. The entire group of bullies plus all of the people working out at the gym are staring and laughing. He attempts to run away in shame, only to be chased by Bozo and gang until he falls out of the window and into a barrel of toxic waste sitting on the back of a waste disposal truck which has been illegally parked in front of the gym, due to the negligence of the drug addicted drivers. His flesh begins to mutate as he catches on fire. Melvin makes his way back home and tries to wash the chemicals from his body but only succeeding in making the issue worse. he passes out and when he awakes, he has been transformed into a mutant monster of superhuman size and strength known as the Toxic Avenger.</p><p>Donning the Name of the Toxic Avenger aka Toxie for short. Toxie's body is filled with Tromatons, which are chemicals that automatically give him the ability to sense danger and evil and gives him an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. He begins systematically cleaning up Tromaville, Killing Cigar-Face and his crew who are torturing a cop and a woman in a alley, Also killing a group of terrorist in a Taco Shop, saving a young blind woman named Sarah who becomes his girlfriend and biggest supporter. But the Corrupt Mayor soon takes notice of Toxie's growing community support, and is worried that the Toxic Avenger may soon be coming for him. So when Toxie kills a seemingly innocent old lady. He issues orders for the police force to kill Toxie. But the civilians don't stand for it for long when they find out that the old lady was not innocent and was in fact the leader of a slavery organization. Still the city's support of the Toxic Avenger does not stop the Mayor from challenging Toxie head on, though Toxie comes out on top, when he disembowels the mayor.</p><h3>Going to Japan</h3><p>After Toxie and Sarah part ways, he eventually meets a new girlfriend whom is also blind named Claire, he and Claire both take up jobs at the Tromaville Center for the Blind. Things are going well, up until a group called Apocalypse blows up the Center for the Blind in an Attempt to kill Toxie. Toxie and Claire survive the blast but no one else does. Toxie proceeds to kill several members of the apocalypse corporation, thinking he has succeeded in chasing the out of town. But the Chairman who is the Leader of Apocalypse has a new plan, the Japan branch of Apocalypse has invented a machine that can take the Tromatons from Toxie's body rendering him powerless. But the Machine cannot be moved to the US, so they pay off Toxie's psychiatrist to trick Toxie into thinking his long lost father is in Japan. and That his name is Big Mac Junko. Toxie who is extremely excited to meet his father, sails to Japan. Once in Japan he makes friends with a young Japanese woman whom he saves from being mugged and killed. The two the go around cleaning the scum out of Japan all the while searching for Toxie's dad. Eventually they come across the man they believe to be Big Mac Junko, in the local fish market. but when Toxie meets his father his Tromatons begin to act up and he realizes his father is evil. When they learn that Big Mac Junko has been smuggling fish filled with cocaine, a fight breaks out when Toxie must fight Big Mac, Big Mac uses the Machine to corrupt The Toxic Avenger's Tromatons, but Toxie manages to get the upper hand when he throws Big Mac onto the local sushi chefs cutting board. The sushi chef begins to hack up Big Mac. But Toxie is weak and dying, when the Japanese girl takes him to a sumo masters dojo, the Sumo wrestlers treat Toxie, and all is well. until he makes his way back to Tromaville.</p><h3>Returning to Tromaville</h3><p>Toxie returns to Tromaville only to discover that it has been taken over by the Chairman and the Apocalypse corporation. Hesitant to take Toxie on Directly, the Chairman sends his greatest soldier, a Motorbiker named the Dark Rider, in a high-speed chase Toxie Battles the Dark Rider and eventually gets the victory when the Dark Rider is Blown up after wrecking.</p><p>Sick of being out done the Chairman reveals his true form, Satan. Satan the prince of Darkness and Tromaville's Greatest hero the Toxic Avenger do one on one battle. Toxie is nearly beaten until he discovers one of his new powers he picked up in Japan. the ability to Urinate acid. He uses this to Defeat the Devil and once again save Tromaville. He is then introduced to his real father Big Mac Junko, and it is revealed that the man he fought in Japan was actually Big Mac Bunko, who had been ruining Junko's name and credit for years.</p><h3>The Noxious Offender</h3><p>For 15 long years the Toxic Avenger and Tromaville lived in peace. Until a rip int the space time continuum merged Toxie's Reality with a parallel one, in which he was a Villain known as the Noxious Offender. Looking virtually identical to Toxie, Noxie used this to his advantage to make Tromaville hate Toxie. but eventually the two were forced into battle in front of both worlds. Toxie won this time not only saving his Tromaville but also saving Noxie's Tomaville. The Two Tromaville's got along splendidly and became one shared world with Toxie as their protector.</p><h2>Toxic Abilities</h2><p>The Toxic bath Melvin took transformed him into a hulking creature with enhanced abilities.Such as:</p><ul><li>Super strength</li><li>Danger sense</li><li>Courage to stop crime</li><li>Invulnerability to injuries</li></ul><h3>Weapon use:</h3><p>Toxie's signature Weapon is a mop and on occasion bare hands.</p><p><b><i>Other Media:</i></b></p><p>Films:</p><p>Troma Entertainment has released 4 Toxic Avenger movies:</p><p>-The Toxic Avenger</p><p>-The Toxic Avenger Part II</p><p>-The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie</p><p>-Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV</p><p>Animation:</p><p>The Ultra-Violent and sexually active Toxie seemed to be the least likely super-hero to receive his own animated series, especially being a creation of Troma. But in the early 90's it happened with the show Toxic Crusaders, which also had it's own toy line, and yes these were both geared towards kids!</p>",

    "deck": "Brian is a talking dog that is a member of the Griffin family in Quahog, Rhode Island. He often drinks and enjoys jazz music.",
    "description": "<p>Brian was born in Austin Texas in a litter of five puppies to Biscuit and Koko. Out of his litter, he was the only one that could talk, or had any human features. He eventually came to Rhode Island to go to school at Brown University, but never graduated.</p> <p>Brian was found by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\">Peter Griffin</a> on a lousy street washing windows with a bottle of cleaner and a newspaper. He appeared to be in bad shape, hungry and dirty. Peter offered to take him home with him, and Brian accepted, and still lives with the Griffin Family.</p> <p>Brian is fairly intelegent, and displays behaviors of both humans and dogs. He can walk upright, drive, and speaks perfect english, but can also speak broken spanish. He is affraid of the vaccum cleaner and often licks himself or eats garbage.</p> <p>Brian loves music, mostly jazz and opera. He loves to sing and dance, and is seen doing so with Stewie Griffin on several occasions. His favorite jazz performer is John Coltrane. He can sing like a barbershop quartet on his own. Brian loves to write as well, as he has written scripts to movies that have never been produced and works on writing a novel in which he never finishes. Stewie makes fun of him that he can never finish his book. He eventually finished his novel \"Faster Than the Speed of Love.\" and it was published and put into Oprah's book club when Lois's father Carter tried to get Brian to do an anti marijuana campaign. The novel became the worst selling book of all time, selling 0 copies worldwide. He has only won one award which was later revealed to be from a group of mentally handicapped adults. He has also written a television pilot \"What I Learned on Jefferson Street.\" which was picked up by CBS. Brian wanted Elijah Wood to play the lead role but they later picked James Woods instead to play the role. CBS then changed his pilot from a drama about a college dropout going back to college for his daughter to a father and daughter going to college comedy. Brian later quit since he couldn't do what he wanted to do with the show.</p> <p>Brian is an alcoholic, and he often drinks hard liquor. He has smoked, and once been involved in drugs like cocaine and marijuana.</p> <p>Brian has held many different part-time jobs, including a drug sniffing dog, a waiter, and a car wash attendant.</p> <p>Brian has had many love intrests. He has dated both human and animals. He is especially in love with Peter's wife, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43709\" href=\"/lois-griffin/4005-43709/\">Lois Griffin</a>. She does not share his love, so he has moved on. He has also dated a dimwitted blonde named Jillian and Hills star Lauren Conrad. Many of his dates have only been for cutaway gags, he has dated girls like the chick from the bathroom sign and some random 40 year old. He was also engaged to a 50 year old Rita but they broke up after Brian slept with a girl in college. Lois's father's dog, Seabreeze, had a relationship with Brian, although she could not talk. They ran away with each other, but they were tracked down, and brought home. Seabreeze became pregnant, and later has children, but the father turns out to be Ted Turner.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Life</h2> <p>Chris Griffin from Family Guy is a whiner. He is frightened by a Supposed \"<a data-ref-id=\"4005-43710\" href=\"/evil-monkey/4005-43710/\">  Evil Monkey</a>\" that lives in his closet although he and the monkey worked it out. He has a semi relationship with his father <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\">  Peter Griffin</a>. He has a wonderful relationship with his mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43709\" href=\"/lois-griffin/4005-43709/\">  Lois Griffin</a>. His Dog, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43705\" href=\"/brian-griffin/4005-43705/\">  Brian Griffin</a> is just an acquaintance. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43708\" href=\"/stewie-griffin/4005-43708/\">  Stewie Griffin</a> does'nt exactly like him him. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43707\" href=\"/meg-griffin/4005-43707/\">  Meg Griffin</a> really doesn’t care.</p> <p>He has a boring yet whining voice. He is overweight and really isn’t that popular and non-educated. He always gets exited when around beautiful women, and has desires. He is a strange teenager. <br /> <br />Education: <br /> <br />Chris has been shown to be very dumb. He shows this quite often like the time when he was watching the Blob on TV and lunged at the TV to save the women in the movie. Although he does not seem intelligent the monkey says that he is very intelligent after listening to Chris talk in his sleep for quite some time. Thanks to Chris talking in his sleep the monkey who wrote Chris's book report which was titled \"The Slave Allegory of Curious George.\". So it is shown that while he is perceived as an idiot he is actually very intelligent. <br /> <br />Romance: <br /> <br />Chris has had quite a bit of luck with girls in his life, most notably Connie Damico who was the most popular girl in school and Meg's archenemy. The two of them later broke up when Chris acted to cocky and cheated on her. Another one of his girlfriends was Anna who worked at the vet, they got along well until Chris took his dad's advice and acted like a jerk to her by demeaning her womanhood. The two later patched it up but it is unknown if they are still going out.</p>",

    "description": "<a href=\"/\"> </a> <h2>Basic Background<br /></h2> <p>Meg Griffin is the first and oldest child of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\">Peter</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43709\" href=\"/lois-griffin/4005-43709/\"> Lois Griffin</a>. Meg could be described as the \"black sheep\" of the Griffin family. She doesn't get any attention, if any. Most times, her father Peter can't even remember her name. And things are no different at school. Meg is branded as very \"unpopular\" and \"nerdy\" among the kids who attend the school. Meg has also been shown to engage in dangerous behavior like self mutilation, and obsessing over <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43705\" href=\"/brian-griffin/4005-43705/\">  Brian</a> in one episode after they made out at a dance. It has also been shown that even though she does not fit in, she will go to extreme lengths to make friends with the popular kids and enjoys any attention she can get from them. In an episode of the show that is based in the future, Meg supposedly becomes a transsexual named \"Ron\".  <br /> <br /></p><h3>Relationships </h3><p><br /> While she has been shown to be ugly she has had a number of boyfriends such as AV club member Neil Goldman but she does not return his advances, she also had a short lived relationship with a prisoner named Luke but ended the relationship when he escaped and sent her to jail. She also had a romantic interest in her neighbor Kevin Swanson but it is unknown if he returns the feelings. One of the only people to return Meg's affections was Doug but he broke up with her once he saw her naked. Boys have also been shown to take great risks to avoid going out with her, the most famous is where one kid kills his brother when she asked him if he would go with her to a dance. She also pretended to be a lesbian in one episode just so she could be friends with a girl.<br /></p>",

He can play a variety of instruments, and is often seen singing and dancing, and doing quite well at it. He learned to play the banjo in a small amount of time, and can also play the piano and the guitar. He is seen in several episodes dancing and singing with Brian or at his musical school. In one such episode, Stewie even performs Bryan Adam's \"Everything I Do (I Do It For You)\" in a music video in order to express his love for Joe Swanson's infant daughter, Susie. </p><p>Stewie is very sophisticated for his age. He often reads complex novels, makes statements of historical times, and watches political television. This is sometimes contradicted by his liking of children's toys, like his bear Rupert who rarely leaves Stewie's side. He likes to watch children television shows, and even once traveled to Europe to meet Mother Maggie, the host of his favorite TV show. She crushed his dreams of living with her, as she turned out to be mean and unbearable.</p><p>Stewie is very intelligent, and is capable of building other worldly objects. He has constructed laser guns, a weather controlling machine, and a size changing ship. The ship was used to go into Peter and keep Bertram from being born.</p><p>Stewie speaks almost perfect English, and is very capable of communicating with adults. They often ignore him, and pass off what he says as baby gibberish. Brian is the only character the readily understands and converses with Stewie, and it is not sure that the other characters can understand what he says.</p><p>There is speculation that Stewie was actually gay. The creator of the show planned to have him step out of the closet, but plans changed when the show was canceled. There are references and actions that may prove this theory.</p><p>He has been shown with Homo Erotic Dreams of him and his Teddy Bear, Rupert and also shown with same kind of dreams with his Dog <a href=\"/brian-griffin/4005-43705/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43705\"> Brian Griffin</a> But love interests with Girls his Age or the short lived love interest with his baby sitter and even being seen in one episode getting aroused by watching Cheer Leaders, All these things contradict the \"Gay\" Theory.</p><p> Stewie's arch nemesis Bertram (who is also his half brother) are always competing on who will dominate the world first. However, Betram has not made an appearance in Family Guy since Season 5. It is also revealed that Stewie has stage fright which was revealed when his preschool put on a production of Terri Shivo the musical and he played the plug. When he was supposed to sing he just wet his pants and started crying. It is also revealed that his hero is Jared, who played the plug 3 years in a row and is now in Kindergarten. Stewie used to adore Hannah Montana and it used to be his favorite show and she used to be his hero, but after he and Brian found out that she was a robot and Brian wanted to see if she could do \"things\" for them, Stewie tried to reprogram her but instead sent her on an evil rampage where she kidnapped the Evil Monkey and did the whole King Kong thing. Luckily Peter and Quagmire shot her down in Quagmire's biplane, she then exploded but. Brian took one of her arms to \"do things\" for him.</p><p> </p><h3>Money</h3><p>: </p><p> </p><p>Stewie has been shown to have quite a few weapons such as grenades ,various types of guns. and crossbows. He is also a master with most of these objects and able to fire them like a master. It is unknown how he has been able to acquire these weapons or if he stole them somehow. </p><p> </p><h3>Jobs</h3><p>: </p><p> </p><p>Despite his young age, Stewie has been shown to have quite a few jobs. One such job was when he took up Chris's paper route after Chris started working at a convenience store. He has also been shown to work at a burger shop and a guidance counselor. </p><p> </p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>: </p><p> </p><p>Stewie has been shown many times as being the smartest person in the family and even smarter than Brian. He has also shown to be a master inventor inventing things such as a multiverse travel system, a shrinking ship, a teleporter,and a time machine. Many times when he is testing these inventions he is accompanied by Brian . </p><p> </p><h3>Murder</h3><p>: </p><p> </p><p>In the episode \"Hannah Banana\" it is revealed that Stewie is a mass murderer having killed seven children and planning to kill all of Brian's siblings. He also set fire to a building killing everyone just to make Brian feel good. He has also killed Chris's future wife. The most recent victim was news reporter Diane Simmons who he murdered because Diane was about to kill Lois and Stewie said that Lois was his to kill.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lois's parents are very wealthy, and she met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\"> Peter Griffin</a> when he was a pool boy. Peter's father hates Lois because of her religion, and Lois's father hates Peter because he is not rich or a high-class citizen.</p> <p>Lois's father seems to not care much about her. Once when she was a child, she was kidnapped, and her father would not help her. She seems to despise her father, and she tries to rebel against him in any way that she can. She married Peter, and she tried to become a model. Peter took Lois to his bar to show off his model wife. All of the guys were hitting on Lois, telling her to take her jacket off. The entire bar started yelling \"jacket off, jacket off\"! She parties and has a wild side, unlike those of most wealthy citizens. She still calls her father Daddy, and seems to try and find ways to find his approval.</p> <p>Lois and her mother have an active relationship, and Lois has a brother and a sister. Her sister, Carol, has had nine husbands, but all have left her. She had one son. Lois also had a brother that her parents had kept secret from her. He is insane, and was placed in an asylum. Her brother walked in on Jackie Gleason and his mother having sex, and was traumatized to the point at where he became a serial killer of fat men. He tried to kill Peter, but was stopped.</p> <p>Lois is considered to be a typical American mother with a loud mouth, but other times she is overly active in sexual activities. She has had affairs with many musicians, notably Gean Simmons. Others include J. Geiles, a pryo technician from Whitesnake, and Hall &amp; Oates. This is perhaps what inspired her to become a part-time piano teacher. Her son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43708\" href=\"/stewie-griffin/4005-43708/\"> Stewie Griffin</a> hates all of the bad pianists in the house, and often tries to stop them from playing. Lois has also had an affair with Bill Clinton. There is also some speculation that Lois is a bisexual, as she has made several comments that suggest this. (ei, \"Women are such teasers, that's why I went back to men.) In the abortion episode it is also revealed that she had \"experimented\" with her old college friend Naomi.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lois is a very attractive women who is often hit on by other people.  She is also shown to be a master hand to hand combatant so much that she was able to beat up her teacher with relative ease.<br />  <br /></p><h3>Religion</h3>: <br /><br />In a recent episode Family Guy Lois discovered that her mother was a Holocaust survivor which made her and her children Jewish. She did not take this seriously while Peter did. Soon though Peter is visited by the ghost of his father who tells him to stop acting Jewish. Lois later starts taking her heritage seriously after talking to her mother. Peter soon dresses up as the Easter Bunny since Lois does not want to celebrate Easter but Jesus visits and tel,ls Peter that he is acting crazy. Her Jewish heritage has not been mentioned since.",

A Recurring joke on the Family Guy show and comic is Chris not wanting to go up to his room because \"The Evil monkey lives in my closet!\"</p> <p>People generally think he's crazy to think such a thing or ignore him. But when Chris goes to his room, A Monkey pops out of his closet pointing his Finger at Chris with an Angry Expression.</p> <p>He wasn't always evil. Upon returning from work to tell his wife of his new promotion to partner, he was startled to find her in bed with another monkey. The three monkeys began to throw a tantrum by jumping up and down and screaming. Following the tantrum, he then pointed with an angry expression at his wife (The same gesture he gives Chris when he enters his room). It should be noted that before becoming evil, he wore a business suit and hat; he also talked and was in a exceptionally good mood (Probably due to his promotion).</p> <p>The Evil Monkey has been seen smoking pot while Chris was away from home. He was also once seen by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\" slug=\"peter-griffin\">Peter</a> while he was running and screaming down the upstairs hallway. Upon seeing him, Peter exclaimed \"Go away, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43707\" href=\"/meg-griffin/4005-43707/\" slug=\"meg-griffin\">Meg</a>!\" and continued running, to which the Evil Monkey replied with a confused look on his face.</p> <p>Most Recently Chris said \"But he's not as evil as he was ever since he became a Jehovah's Witness\". <br/> <br/>Recently the evil monkey left Chris's closet and started a new life in Jake Tucker's closet. It is revealed that he twitches because he has a copper deficency and that he points because he is trying to make conversation. He also became good friends with Chris and somewhat replaced Peter as his father. The evil monkey has not been heard from since.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Glen Quagmire is a sexually diviant airline pilot who is very well known for his popular catch phrases which include \"Giggity Giggity Goo\" (and variations thereof, excited), \"Allright!\" (Slyly) and \"Oh!\" (usually partnered with a pelvic thrust). </p> <p>Quagmire is described as being a heartless sex hound who is stuck in the 1950s days of swingers and rat-pack era. He has a large dictionary of sexual innuendo and is prone to like almost any fetish, from almost sleeping with his mother to almost sleeping with a dead woman. </p> <p>Quagmire is also said to have a dangerously sexual obsession with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43701\" href=\"/peter-griffin/4005-43701/\">Peter Griffin's</a> wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43709\" href=\"/lois-griffin/4005-43709/\">Lois Griffin</a>. Many actions indicate this obsession from stealing toe nail clipping and pieces of hair to going through her trash cans at night. Quagmire has even been charged with sexual harrasment when caught spying on Lois Griffin in a public bathroom. </p> <p>Quagmire again finds himself in quicksand when he is caught sleeping with best friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43714\" href=\"/cleveland-brown/4005-43714/\">Cleveland's</a> wife Loretta Brown. This affair finally lead to Cleveland wanting Quagmire dead, despite Clevelands acceptance at first. Glen spends most of his days at the local pub \"The Drunken Clam\" with best friends Peter Griffen, Cleveland Brown and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43712\" href=\"/joe-swanson/4005-43712/\">Joe Swanson</a>. </p>Quagmire's first marrriage was to Joan whose last name is unknown. She is a maid who was first assigned to clean the Griffin's household, her and Glenn then fell instantly in love. Once Glenn had wed Joan he realises that despite being married he cannot change the way he looks at other girls and tries to fake his death to get out of the marriage. Joan is killed by death <i>accidently </i>during Quagmire's \"funeral\" in which he had also faked. <br /> <br />It is revealed in a recent episode that he hates <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43705\" href=\"/brian-griffin/4005-43705/\">Brian</a> for being such a bore, a terrible father, and for hitting on Lois. Quagmire is also shown to have a foot fetish so much as he will sniff women's shoes while bowling and as a wedding gift Peter got him the foot of the Statue of Liberty so that Quagmire could sniff it. It is also revealed that the only that does not \"excite\" Quagmire is when people say rubbish instead of garbage. <br /> <br />In a newer episode, Quagmire saw his father who later revealed that he wanted a sex change operation to which Quagnire oposses. Quagmire later comes to accept his fathers decision but beats up Brian who slept with his father not knowing that she used to be a man.",

    "description": "<p>Named after the Cleveland Browns NFL team, Cleveland Brown is a gentle, polite and patient man once married to Loretta Brown with son Cleveland Jr. Cleveland's divorce was a result of best friend Glen Quagmire sleeping with Loretta as a result of a Cleveland's \"soft\" attitude towards his wife and passion-less love life.</p><p>Cleveland Jr seems to be quite the opposite of his father, being over-energetic, loud and a very short attention span making him a possible ADHD child. Recently Cleveland Jr. has been portrayed as overweight, sympathetic, and inactive. He also has a hard time making friends, his only real friend seems to be Ernie Krinklesac. Cleveland Jr. is also shown to have an obsessive compulsive disorder in which he needs to keep things clean. </p><p> Cleveland often receives different treatment for his race throughout the Family Guy series, example being when he is treated over-violently by police authorities.</p><p>Cleveland shares a lot of his time with best friends Peter Griffin, Glen Quagmire and Joe Swanson at their local pub \"The Drunken Clam\". </p><h3>Cleveland Show</h3><p>After finalizing his divorce with Loretta, Cleveland decides to move to Hollywood with Cleveland jr.. They stop in Stoolbend, Virginia (His home town.) for a few days and meets up with his old high school friend Donna Tubbs. Cleveland had always harbored romantic feelings for Donna which she was unaware of. He comes to stay with her and her two children Rallo and Roberta with whom he quickly forms somewhat of a bond . Cleveland and Donna soon get married and he settles down for his new life with Donna, Roberta, Rallo, and Cleveland Jr.. Cleveland also finds replacements for his friends by meeting redneck racist Lester Krinklesac, animatronic bear Tim the Bear, midget Holt Rickter, and old best friend Terry Kimple. The new formed team hangs out in the \"Broken Stool.\" almost similar to how the guys met in Family Guy. Cleveland soon gets a job with Tim and Terry at Waterman Cable as a cable install men. Recently it was revealed that Loretta died by falling out of her bathtub and snapping her neck. When he cried at her funeral it put his new marriage in question. It was also revealed that his parents were Evelyn \"Cookie\" Brown and LeVar \"Freight Train\" Brown. It is also revealed that Cleveland is very talented at baseball and played for his school team. He was so good that they retired his jersey number 9 and earned the nickname \"Hot Brown.\" He has also been revealed to play basketball with Barack Obama when they were kids but he knew him as Barry Obama so he was not aware until recently that Barry and Barack Obama were the same person. It is also revealed that he has a brother named Roderick who saved Cleveland from a drug dealer with Afgani Heroin. Cleveland also lost his virginity at the age of nine. He was also conceived during the seventh inning stretch at an Indian's game which tells us why he is named Cleveland. He also whistled the national anthem at the 1983 world series.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>In the Cleveland Show he is shown to be a very loyal friend. One such example is when him and his friends went to New York City and Cleveland had to save Tim from a bar, he had to stab Donald Trump to save Holt, and had to save Lester after he used the N word. Another time when Lester lost his son to child services, Cleveland helped him get Ernie back from the government. Cleveland has also been shown to know very little about romance, such as when he and Donna went to New York city, he spent the whole time saving his friends for various problems.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>Cleveland has been shown to have high blood pressure. Donna tried to help him by putting him on a high fiber diet but this only makes him fart very badly. His iconic mustache was also shown to deepen his voice. When Cleveland Jr. cut it off, Cleveland discovered that without his mustache he had a high pitched girly voice. He later got a transplant Ron Goldman mustache.</p>",

Gerard Yves Martet was a prejudiced Anti-Semite who blamed immigrants for the corruption of his country.

    "deck": "Montolio is a blind ranger who befriends Drizzt Do'urden and guides him on the beginning of the path of the ranger, leading him to become a follower of the goddess Mielikki.",
    "description": "<p>The local Orc Chieftain, Graul, hears of Drizzt's presence in the area. Scared that the drow was a threat to his authority, he sends some of his minions to kill Drizzt and Guen. They found Drizzt walking with Guenhwyvar through the local forest, enjoying his first spring. He was enamored by the new growth literally springing from the once dead ground. So enamored, in fact, he was caught by surprise by the attacking orcs. Drizzt easily killed the first two attackers, but was taken down by one of their feral wolves, pinned until he could call for Guenhwyvar. Even with the wolf off his back, he was severely disadvantaged, and would have been slain by a third orc if not for the timely intervention of an arrow in the beast's back. All enemies now dead, Drizzt looks up to see an old, green clad human bearing down on him with a great wooden bow. <b><i>\"You're my prisoner,\"</i></b> the newcomer stately matter of factly, to which Drizzt responds, <b><i>\"I think not.\"</i></b> Guen moves in to flank the human, and the man reaches out a hand to the great cat. Guen licks the old man's hand like an old friend.</p><p>Intrigued with the bearing and intent of Drizzt, the old man introduces himself as the ranger Montolio Debrouchee. Drizzt soon comes to realize that the man is blind, and is amazed that he could function well, let alone fire an arrow accurately in that condition. Montolio warns him that he had killed minions of Graul, something the Orc Chieftan will not allow to go unpunished. Because of his blindness, the orcs believe Montolio is \"bad magic\" and will not approach his castle. He tells Drizzt that coming to live with him is the safest place. Drizzt refuses, saying <b><i>\"You would be better served, Montolio Debrouchee, to keep away from me. I bring trouble.\"</i></b> Even after more prodding and assurances of safety from the old ranger, Drizzt still refuses. So, Montolio leaves Drizzt behind, taking Guenhwyvar with him. It was Guen's trust of the man that changed Drizzt heart. He knew that the great cat's instincts had never been wrong before, and he did not relish the idea of facing an army of orcs on his own.</p> Drizzt follows Montolio to his \"castle,\" which in reality was a grove of massive trees reaching as high as could be seen. Each tree was a living house, whole rooms carved out of the tree's insides, this internal stairway reaching up into the highest regions of the grove. Wood and rope bridges connected the trees to one another, providing not only easy access across the heights, but also numerous positions from which to watch and defend the grove. In his short life, Drizzt had seen dwelling places more fantastic than this, but none more welcoming. Drizzt hoped that he had finally found a place to call home, but worried that something would find him and destroy it, despite the assurances of Montolio.<p>Drizzt and Montolio began a long and fast friendship, his only real friend since leaving Belwar behind so many months ago. But more than friendship, Montolio began teaching Drizzt about the ways of the surface world, lessons that were critical to a ranger. He explained the seasons, how to anticipate changes in the weather, the behavior of animals, and the usefulness of plants. Drizzt learned to forage, and how to understand the emotions of an animal by observing its movements. Montolio knew he would progress, quickly, but was continually surprised by the demeanor of this drow, he lived and saw things as a surface elf might. In fact, he seems more attuned than many light elves Montolio had met, seemingly already possessing a natural ranger's heart.</p> Having been told of Drizzt's missing scimitar by the owl Hooter, Montolio takes the dark elf to a hidden armory and bestows on him a fine blade. When Drizzt thanks him for the blade and promises to care for it and only use it when he must, Montolio says, <b><i>\"Oh, you'll use it now.\"</i></b> At first, Drizzt thought it dishonorable to duel a blind opponent, but was eventually pressed into it by the old ranger. Battling with the flats of their blades, Drizzt found he was easily matched. When fighting in the dark, Drizzt often had the advantage over surface races because of his night vision, but what good was night vision against someone who could fight blind? Drizzt underestimated the old ranger, and was quickly put down. When Drizzt asks how he could have known, the blind man says, <b><i>\"You told my yourself. In attitude. The suddden shuffle of your fee, the way your breathing changed as you prepared to leap—what you planned was obvious. You've much to learn, elf.\"</i></b> He walked away, leaving the elf standing flatfooted.<p>When summer came, an unwanted visitor arrived, bringing all his usual bluster and lying with him, Roddy McGristle. He demanded to know from the ranger if he had seen the drow, or knew where he might be found. In addition, his lies about the dark elf continued to grow more extreme, reporting to Montolio that Drizzt had not only killed the Thistledown family, but that Guenhwyvar had also eaten one of them. Montolio lies and tells him he had heard the drow went to a place called Morueme's Cave, a place 150 miles in the opposite direction through treacherous terrain. After the evil man was gone, Drizzt came and pleaded his innocence to Montolio, something which the old ranger already knew, having spoken to Dove Falconhand, who had not only told of his innocence, but of his rescue of her and her men.</p> Later on, Montolio began to tell Drizzt about his own personal history. He had once been a warrior in addition to a ranger. He had given his life to the protection of the forest at an early age, and took up a life of adventuring, sometimes fighting with others, sometimes alone. He traveled the length and breadth of the north, putting to death monsters and unnatural things that were a threat to the natural order. His days of travel were abruptly ended, however, when he was washed in dragonfire from a great red dragon. The healers were able to heal him nearly completely, even the scarring of his skin, but were not able to save his eyes, leaving him in his blinded state. Montolio, despising the pity of his companions, came to the forest grove to die, but instead found purpose when he was visited by Mielikki, the mistress goddess of the forest.<p>In response to his tale, Drizzt says, <b><i>\"I have no god, and nor do I want one.\"</i></b> He goes on to tell about his disgust with his people and the evilness of Lolth, asserting that to follow a god is folly. He insists that he will follow his heart instead. Montolio counters by saying that Drizzt has a god, but just does not know its name. As proof, he points out the likeness of heart Drizzt shares with Guenhwyvar, and the great cat herself is the entity of the panther, a creature of Mielikki's domain. <b><i>\"You know Mielikki's laws as well as I. You've been following them all your life, you just didn't know it.\"</i></b> The ranger's words struck at the drow's heart, hitting him fully with the ring of truth, causing Drizzt to finally acquiesce and say, <b><i>\"I-I wish to learn more our your—our goddess.\"</i></b></p> Drizzt's enemy, Roddy McGristle turned and looked for allies, even such creatures he would normally never have contact with, Graul the Orc Chieftain. Roddy knew that Graul's minions had been unable to find the drow, so Roddy  informed them he was with the ranger, and that they were plotting together against the orcs. A consummate liar, Roddy went on to convine the Orc Chieftain that they were planning on rousing all the elves, and dwarves, and forest animals against the orc tribe. This roused the ire of Graul, who then decides to muster his forces and attack the grove. At that moment, Tephanis and Caroak stride into the cave, promising to rouse the worgs against the ranger and his grove. The war was about to be joined. Hooter, having spied the preparations for the orc and worgs, flies back and tells Montolio of all he has seen. War is finally coming to the grove, a war which Montonlio had been prepared for for years.<p>Graul, Caroak, and Roddy were quickly successful in amassing a fairly large force in a short time, a group consisting of a hundred orc warriors, a few giants, and a dozen wargs. Together, they set out down the crags and crevasses of the high peaks and moved methodically toward the grove of Montolio below. In that very same grove, Montolio explained to Drizzt how he had known this night would come, expeciting it for five years. He had played out every possible scenario in his mind, and had stockpiled the necessary weapons and supplies to defend the grove all on his own. He now felt he had a greater advantage with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar at his side. So they began to prepare for the battle, readying weapons, calling in animal allies, and setting traps until all they could do was wait. They did not have long to rest.</p><p>From behind his seemingly overwhelming force, Graul calls for the attack. Orcs and wargs stream toward the grove, looking to tear apart any living thing they met, whether sentient being or plant. From high above on the rope bridges, Drizzt ran from crossbow to crossbow, each of which was already loaded with large bolts, and began firing into the crowd with deadly accuracy. He made every shot count, not daring to miss and lose any slight advantage over the attacking hoard. Montolio, hiding in the shadows, used the grunts and clanking armor to give him targets, their loudness creating beacon bright targets for the blind man. The bear Drizzt had bedded down with during his first winter, and other animals came out of the woods and slew orc after orc, quickly thinning the number of enemies against the grove's protectors.</p> When Drizzt gets to his last arrow, he finally sees McGristle in the fray below him. While he wanted to put his personal grief at an end by killing the lying hunter, he also spied the Orc Chieftain Graul next to him, and he reasoned that killing Graul would end the attack for good. His choice made, he fired at the orc, but Roddy noticed the arrow at the last moment and pushed the orc out of the way. Drizzt's final shot had been wasted. All the traps have been sprung, and both Montolio and the drow were out of arrows, so they drew their swords and leaped headlong into the remaining enemies. Whether orc, warg or giant, the two rangers were more than a match for their enemies, leaving no recourse but to run from the grove as fast as their feet would carry them. Even after all this, Roddy prodded Graul to go in himself and fight back, believing the two of them were more than a match for the rangers. Graul knew his men would follow him if he led another charge, but the Orc Chieftain was not one to risk his own life. He bashed Roddy upside the head, knocking him unconscious, and ran for his life. The battle was over.       Life in the grove returned to normal, and Montolio and Drizzt passed the remainder of the summer peacefully. Montolio taught Drizzt everthing there was to know about every plant and animal in the region, but more importantly, Montolio taught him how to learn for himself. Drizzt learned to observe the world around him, looking and listening for the hints that Mielikki gave him in his heart. When fall came, Montolio began to slow down dramatically, he tired easily, and suffered from back and joint pain. He warned Drizzt that his time in the world would not last much longer, and that the drow should prepare for what comes next. When Drizzt says he will stay and watch over the grove, Montolio tells him it is not the life for the young drow, and makes him promise he will leave the grove and go in search of his place in the world. Reluctantly, Drizzt does just that.       One day, while foraging for the food to store fo the coming winter, Drizzt arrived back at the grove just as the first snows were beginning to fall. Usually, the grove was full of life, birds flitting around and animals playing beneath the trees. This day, everything was silent, and suddenly Drizzt knew the day he had been dreading had finally come. He rushed through the grove, finding Montolio resting against one of his beloved trees, finally at his eternal peace.  Drizzt buried Montolio in the midst of the grove, then waited out the winter in the safety and warmth of the grove. Montolio's favorite animal, the owl Hooter, stayed on until one day late in the season, then he took flight and never returned. When spring came, the animals did not return, and the grove became on unsettling place. Drizzt fulfilled his promise to his dead friend, and set his face away from the grove to travel the world once again.",

    "deck": "Graul is an orc king of a tribe near Montolio Debrouchee's sacred grove. He decides, after some prodding by Roddy McGristle, that he must kill Drizzt Do'urden.",
    "description": "<p>News of Drizzt arrival spread throughout the surrounding countryside, pleasing some with the news, but causing fear and trepidation in Graul. Minions of the Orc Chieftan had seen the drow enter their environs before the snows set in, and Graul had commanded them to set a watch over him, but secretly hoped the snow would drive him away. Since that had not happened, and the dark elf had survived the winter, Graul wondered if this lone drow were a scout for a larger force to come, bringing war with them. If the drow were alone, he might come in and try to usurp leadership of his tribe. Neither situation could be allowed to stand, so he orders his men to go and kill the elf.</p> They found Drizzt walking through the local forest, enjoying his first spring. He was enamored by the new growth literally springing from the once dead ground. So enamored, in fact, he was caught by surprise by the attacking orcs. Drizzt easily killed the first two attackers, but was taken down by one of their feral wolves, pinned until he could call for Guenhwyvar. Even with the wolf off his back, he was severely disadvantaged, and would have been slain by a third orc if not for the timely intervention of an arrow in the beast's back. All enemies now dead, Drizzt looks up to see an old, green clad human bearing down on him with a great wooden bow.       Roddy McGristle turned and looked for allies, even such creatures he would normally never have contact with, Graul the Orc Chieftain. Roddy knew that Graul's minions had been unable to find the drow, so Roddy  informed them he was with the ranger, and that they were plotting together against the orcs. A consummate liar, Roddy went on to convine the Orc Chieftain that they were planning on rousing all the elves, and dwarves, and forest animals against the orc tribe. This roused the ire of Graul, who then decides to muster his forces and attack the grove. At that moment, Tephanis and Caroak stride into the cave, promising to rouse the worgs against the ranger and his grove. The war was about to be joined. Hooter, having spied the preparations for the orc and worgs, flies back and tells Montolio of all he has seen. War is finally coming to the grove, a war which Montonlio had been prepared for for years.<p>Graul, Caroak, and Roddy were quickly successful in amassing a fairly large force in a short time, a group consisting of a hundred orc warriors, a few giants, and a dozen wargs. Together, they set out down the crags and crevasses of the high peaks and moved methodically toward the grove of Montolio below. In that very same grove, Montolio explained to Drizzt how he had known this night would come, expeciting it for five years. He had played out every possible scenario in his mind, and had stockpiled the necessary weapons and supplies to defend the grove all on his own. He now felt he had a greater advantage with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar at his side. So they began to prepare for the battle, readying weapons, calling in animal allies, and setting traps until all they could do was wait. They did not have long to rest.</p><p>From behind his seemingly overwhelming force, Graul calls for the attack. Orcs and wargs stream toward the grove, looking to tear apart any living thing they met, whether sentient being or plant. From high above on the rope bridges, Drizzt ran from crossbow to crossbow, each of which was already loaded with large bolts, and began firing into the crowd with deadly accuracy. He made every shot count, not daring to miss and lose any slight advantage over the attacking hoard. Montolio, hiding in the shadows, used the grunts and clanking armor to give him targets, their loudness creating beacon bright targets for the blind man. The bear Drizzt had bedded down with during his first winter, and other animals came out of the woods and slew orc after orc, quickly thinning the number of enemies against the grove's protectors.</p> When Drizzt gets to his last arrow, he finally sees McGristle in the fray below him. While he wanted to put his personal grief at an end by killing the lying hunter, he also spied the Orc Chieftain Graul next to him, and he reasoned that killing Graul would end the attack for good. His choice made, he fired at the orc, but Roddy noticed the arrow at the last moment and pushed the orc out of the way. Drizzt's final shot had been wasted. All the traps have been sprung, and both Montolio and the drow were out of arrows, so they drew their swords and leaped headlong into the remaining enemies. Whether orc, warg or giant, the two rangers were more than a match for their enemies, leaving no recourse but to run from the grove as fast as their feet would carry them. Even after all this, Roddy prodded Graul to go in himself and fight back, believing the two of them were more than a match for the rangers. Graul knew his men would follow him if he led another charge, but the Orc Chieftain was not one to risk his own life. He bashed Roddy upside the head, knocking him unconscious, and ran for his life. The battle was over.",

    "deck": "A fiesty 300-year old succubus who just wants to have fun, at first. Eventually, however, she accepts her responsibility as the next ruler of the Makai Realm after her father Belial's death.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Morrigan was deemed too powerful by her father Belial, and her power was split into three. One part she got to keep, the second Belial kept and the third was sealed away. The third part eventually became <a href=\"/lilith/4005-44107/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44107\">Lilith</a>. After the death of Belial, Morrigan became one of the rulers of the Makai and the head of the Aensland family, although she was adopted.</p><p>Although the responsibilities inevitably fall on her shoulders, Morrigan continues to hide from her troubles in the human world. When <a href=\"/jedah/4005-44108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44108\">Jedah</a>'s castle merged with hers, Morrigan sensed Lilith within the merged castles, collectively called the Majigen, and ventured forth to find her. When the two met, they merged into one, thus Morrigan reclaimed the second third of her born power.</p><p>Afterwards, Morrigan learned that her old enemy, <a href=\"/demitri-maximoff/4005-43799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43799\">Demitri Maximoff</a>, had been revitalized. She used this as an opportunity to test her newly reclaimed power and challenged him. Although she defeated him quite quickly, Demitri was able to teleport away and restore his strength, waiting for the right time to strike.</p><h2>Comic Origin</h2><p>Morrigan was adopted by Belial and he dubbed her his future heir but foresaw in her future a long, arduous battle between her and Demitri Maximoff, who would seem to have the upper hand but Morrigan came from the attack unscathed and defeated him and simply smiled. Belial was afraid that if left unchecked Morrigan's full power would consume and kill her.</p><p>After the vision, Belial took it upon himself to seal half of her powers away, which later became the form of Lilith. Morrigan grew and eventually became bored with her home, so she snuck into the human world having fun by trading \"Eternal Bliss\" for the souls of men.</p><p>She returns to find out a horrible secret from her father. Finally realizing her destiny, Morrigan left to prove herself by going to take down Demitri for the last time, meanwhile, being tracked by the Hutzil robot minions of <a href=\"/pyron/4005-44099/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44099\">Pyron</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Morrigan, being a succubus has the power of seduction. The bats that surround her are the souls of the men she's seduced. The bats shapeshift into wings and projectile attacks. She also lives longer than mortal beings, she is 300 years of age.</p><p>Morrigan can also transform herself and her outfits, but can be revealed by mirrors. When she merges with Lilith, Morrigan becomes a dangerous force able to withstand the strongest of attacks and able to deal them out as well.</p>",

His true origin is unknown, however it is known that he was shunned as a child for his tainted blood. One day, a terrible event occurred in his hometown which had something to do with him. The end result was the death of everyone in the town, including his mother. Donovan wandered the world for a long time, following the teachings of Buddhism in an attempt to control his massive power as well as inner turmoil. Donovan is a man who seeks an answer to his cursed existence. Along his journeys as a wandering monk, he learned many things, and eventually came into possession of a gigantic magical sword known as <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dhylec/4005-44110/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44110\">Dhylec</a>. This sword had the unique ability to channel the spirits of various elementals and gods for use of their power. Combined with his powerful telekinetic abilities, his strength, his mental discipline as well as the power of Dhylec and his spirit beads worn around his body, Donovan became a force of justice to be feared by all evil. The <a href=\"/darkstalkers/4060-54964/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54964\">Darkstalker</a>s' arrogance may have been their undoing with the creation of Donovan.</p><p>Donovan is a Dark Hunter but is not part of any official organization of dark hunters. He does not hunt for profit like <a href=\"/b-b-hood/4005-44105/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44105\">Baby Bonnie Hood</a> does. His reasons are spiritual in that hunting the dark gives him a meaning to his existence, to protect others from the dark, and maybe even cleanse himself of his tainted blood. On one of his journeys, Donovan came across a young girl named <a href=\"/anita/4005-44104/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44104\">Anita</a>. As Donovan came onto the scene, she was threatened by a monster. Donovan easily dispatched it, and turned to the villagers for an explanation. The people told him that Anita had never exhibited any kind of emotion or said any words since her family was slaughtered by a Darkstalker.</p><p>Taking his sword Dhylec, he slicing off the head of Anita's doll. Anita responded with a violent psychic force. Donovan subdued the attack and told her that anger was the most easily summoned emotion, but that this was proof that she could still heal her own heart. He welcomed Anita to accompany him not only to find herself but to aid him in battle, as she had some unique abilities as well. Thus, Donovan became her guardian, and Anita has kept the headless doll ever since.</p><h3>Dee (Evil Donovan)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/5447915-dee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5447915\" data-ratio=\"1.2391304347826\" data-width=\"322\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 322px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.9%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/5447915-dee.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5447915\"><img alt=\"Dee\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/5447915-dee.png\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/5447915-dee.png 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" data-width=\"516\"></a><figcaption>Dee</figcaption></figure><p>In his ending in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/night-warriors-darkstalkers-revenge/3030-9542/\">Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge</a>, Donovan finally loses his humanity as he sacrifices himself somewhat in order to protect Anita as well as awaken her emotion again. Although Donovan is victorious, he succumbed to the dark part of his soul too much in order to do so. This tragic turn of events causes Anita to cry, and is symbolic in showing that Anita is finally whole again. Years later, a grown Anita wonders what became of Donovan, and she hopes he's okay. Sadly however, we find Donovan sitting on a throne, beside many bodies. He is fighting a never ending struggle with himself as he yearns for inner peace.</p><p>Dee is the true, present day Donovan, somewhat corrupted and a \"what if\" if his Vampire Hunter ending was indeed canon. In Dee's ending, he confronts Anita, who shows her true form and he begins to fight an aged Anita. The outcome of this fight isn't shown but during the credits various pictures are shown of an aged Anita visiting a grave. It is assumed that the grave is Donovan's and that she won the fight and killed him, and it is still unknown whether this is a canon event or something of a \"what if.\"</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4173180\" data-ratio=\"1.294498381877\" data-width=\"618\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4173180\"><img alt=\"Ice, Fire, and Lighting Gods\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg 618w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg 494w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ice, Fire, and Lighting Gods\" src=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg 618w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105264/4173180-donovan+baine5265.jpg 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" data-width=\"494\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ice, Fire, and Lighting Gods</figcaption></figure><p>Donovan's primary attacks utilize both his martial arts training and his large demon slaying sword, Dhylec. His psychokinetic abilities allow him to levitate Dhylec off the ground and can even ride it through the air. He can also ensnare opponents with his psychokinesis, suspend them in the air, and slam them on the ground as seen in his grab attack. His large prayer beads or <i>japa malas</i> can be used as a barrier or can be swung towards enemies. When they are swung, they give off an aura of blue and white energy. With both Dhylec and his prayer beards, Donovan can summon gods from Buddhist and Hindu mythology (though the wind god in the Press of Death attack appears to be from Greek mythology) to fight alongside him.</p><p>He can also temporarily revert to his true form as a Darkstalker, a dark skinned human-like demon with yellow hair and wings. He flies at his enemy and emits a large ball of lightning against his foe in this state.</p><h3>Dee</h3><p>Essentially Donovan but with more powerful moves and a mix of <a href=\"/demitri-maximoff/4005-43799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43799\">Demitri</a>'s moves and even a laser projectile.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Comics</h3><p>In the UDON Comics Darkstalkers series, he fought <a href=\"/bishamon/4005-43748/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43748\">Bishamon</a> and various other creatures of darkness.</p><h3>Animated</h3><h4>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (1997)</h4><p>Donovan is the main protagonist in the 1997 four-episode <a href=\"/night-warriors-darkstalkers-revenge/4075-284/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-284\">anime series</a>.

She was born as a normal human in <a href=\"/las-vegas/4020-55734/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55734\">Las Vegas</a>, <a href=\"/nevada/4020-55779/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55779\">Nevada</a>, and was orphaned shortly after birth. At around the age of six, she started to grow fur and feline appendages, including cat ears, paws, and a tail.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Felicia was raised in an orphanage by a nun named Rose who is still alive and takes a very active in Felicia's life and career. Felicia hopes to one day become a star, singing and acting her way to fame. One of her roles include starring in The Feline of Oz as the Dorothy character in that particular re-imagining of the classic tale.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She soon learns that the demand for an actress with her unique... appendages is somewhat lower than she'd hope. On her path to stardom, she crosses paths with the werewolf <a href=\"/jon-talbain/4005-43806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43806\">Jon Talbain</a> who is pessimistic where she is optimistic. She auditions for the part of Lady Macbeth, which is the first time she sees Jon as a werewolf.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">All of the kids at the orphanage adore Felicia, who took Jon Talbain there in an effort to show him that humanity isn't as vile and treacherous as he believes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As a kid, Charles took an interest in animal rights and plant preservation.  His family supported him as much as possible.  When he went to college he brought his favorite ficus, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56048\" href=\"/susie/4005-56048/\" slug=\"susie\">Susie</a>.  He always talked to Susie, preferring her to other people, since she didn't talk back or judge him.  When he gained his powers, he found that plants hate people!!  They think that we are cruel to kill the planet and move plants wherever we think they should be.  He also found out that Susie was in love with him!  Before becoming green thumb, he was a vegetarian.  Now he eats only tofu as all the vegetables scream and plead for their lives as he eats them.  Charles acts on the team mostly gathering information from plants in any given area, since they are the perfect spies!  No one pays attention to them, which pisses them off as well.  Charles is trying to adjust to his new life.</p><p>Charles Levy is a member of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43190\" href=\"/freshmen/4060-43190/\" slug=\"freshmen\">Freshmen</a>, a superhero team based out of the Boughl Science Building of Freese College.

    "description": "<p>Hunter Brawn was laundering lots of money through the bank of which <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4562\" href=\"/jubilee/4005-4562/\">Jubilee</a>'s (Jubilation Lee) father was the president. When Mr. Lee threatened to go to the police, Mr. Brawn had both of Jubilee's parents killed.  Later, through her own investigative work, Jubilee came to the conclusion that Hunter Brawn was responsible for her parents' murder.  She sought revenge on him by interrogation, stealth, and hand to hand combat.  With the help of her Generation X teammates, Mr. Brawn was subdued.  During the confrontation, Hunter Brawn's warehouse was massively damaged by Jubilee's energy blasts.</p><p>Mr. Brawn was a power hungry and wealthy individual, until Mr. Lu, an old employee of Mr. Lee's who was in on the whole thing, confessed to the police. This, combined with Jubilee's revenge, led to the arrest of Mr. Brawn.</p><p>Hunter Brawn told his grandson <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43772\" href=\"/tristan-brawn/4005-43772/\">Tristan Brawn</a> not to worry, that his lawyers would get him out of this, to which Tristan solemnly replied, \"No, they won't.\"</p><p>Tristan left his stunned grandfather, who sadly watched him leave. It's unknown whether the two have spoken since.</p>",

Her people's advanced technology allows her to have superhuman abilities in the form of a special suit she wears; once the battery runs out, however, she'll be powerless. She was one of the few Children of the Vault to survive their initial encounter with the X-Men, however that initial incident creating animosity between the two powered super groups. Serafina's curiosity in particular leading to an interesting relationship with the X-Men member Cannonball whom she spent a simulated lifetime with as a partner. This was only a temporary situation but there is a slight tension between both characters. </p><h2>Creation  </h2>Serafina was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41673\" href=\"/mike-carey/4040-41673/\" slug=\"mike-carey\">Mike Carey</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-1941\" href=\"/chris-bachalo/4040-1941/\" slug=\"chris-bachalo\">Chris Bachalo</a> and first appeared in X-Men Vol 2 (2006) alongside the rest of her team the Children of the Vault. Like her fellow Children of the vault Serafina, has Spanish influences, her alternative name Seraph Seraphim. <br/>  <br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><b>Supernovas</b>  <br/><p>Because of her affinity for machines (including the biological kind), she could disrupt machine and human senses, sneak into an <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" slug=\"x-men\">X-Men</a> facility undetected. Only <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> sensed that something was amiss. Serafina's suit had wiry tendrils coming out of it that allowed her to interface with technological as well as biological systems, such as when she plugged into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12055\" href=\"/lady-mastermind/4005-12055/\" slug=\"lady-mastermind\">Lady Mastermind</a> in order to use Lady Mastermind's powers on Cannonball with far greater power and skill at her command than Lady Mastermind could ever summon naturally.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/121791-2419-serafina.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-121791\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0675\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:206.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/121791-2419-serafina.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-121791\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/121791-2419-serafina.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3848/121791-2419-serafina.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p>Serafina was first seen tracking <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\" href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" slug=\"sabretooth\">Sabretooth</a>, using her psychometric abilities, with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43916\" href=\"/sangre/4005-43916/\" slug=\"sangre\">Sangre</a> for their evil plans. She was also able to enhance and use the powers of others at will, perhaps as a result of her innate ability to understand biological systems, which is what she did to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\" href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" slug=\"northstar\">Northstar</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3189\" href=\"/aurora/4005-3189/\" slug=\"aurora\">Aurora</a> before she mind-controlled them into attacking the X-Men.</p><p>She used a comatose Lady Mastermind's illusion-casting abilities to create a world in Cannonball's mind in which they were married and her name was Sarah. When she was discovered by Wolverine, she turned his adamantium skeleton against him, defeated Cannonball, and fled to rejoin her team.</p><p>Later, when The Children of the Vault were attacking the X-Men (and winning, to boot...), Cannonball attempted to reach Serafina through the memories they shared in the world where they were married.</p><p>When she told him that she had no real feelings for him at all, he grabbed her and drove her straight into the hull of the ship at full speed, which, as far as we know, killed her. <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41673\" href=\"/mike-carey/4040-41673/\" slug=\"mike-carey\">Mike Carey</a>, the writer of the issue, has said in an interview, however, that she may have been merely knocked out and she isn't dead for sure, in contrast to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43918\" href=\"/fuego/4005-43918/\" slug=\"fuego\">Fuego</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43917\" href=\"/aguja/4005-43917/\" slug=\"aguja\">Aguja</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43916\" href=\"/sangre/4005-43916/\" slug=\"sangre\">Sangre</a>, whom he implied were really dead. </p><b>Collision </b> <br/>Most recently Serafina was seen with the team of Children of the Vault who came to retrieve Luz, an escapee who had found shelter with Rogue and Magneto. Serafina along with her fellow Children of the Vault defeat the X-Men, opting to capture both Rogue, for her former crimes against the Children, and as per Serafina's suggestion Magneto, as she recognizes in him great power that may allow him to be used to sustain the Angelfire device - a device used to power the Children of the Vaults city. <br/><h2>Powers and Abilties  </h2>Serafina's powers are a combination of natural genetics and advanced technological amplification, much like her fellow Children of the Vault. She is a technopath, which essentially means she can control, talk to, communicate and manipulate machines. More than this though, with the cords and cables that can extend from designated ports into her body she can extend her consciousness, not just to machines, and computers, but systems as complex and organic as the human nervous system thus allowing her to manipulate living peoples memories and senses as easy as rewriting and erasing traditional computer data. Examples of her ability to modify and manipulate include using Lady Mastermind's powers to trick Cannonball into thinking that he had married and spent a life time with a women named Sarah, and temporarily turning Wolverine's adamantium into a more toxic version of itself (Adamantium nine) <br/><br/>Serafina is fluent in both English and Spanish. She is also an excellent tracker as well as being able to cloak herself and large groups of people. Often cloaking her entire team for stealth missions. She also has default super strength and the ability to see beyond the visual spectrum. ",
