    "deck": "He's a demon on wheels. Speed Racer is the younger brother of thought to be deceased Rex Racer and after his death Speed went out and raced like no other, winning races one at a time.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Origin</h2><p><i>According to the NOW Comics series</i></p><p>Gregory \"Speed\" Racer and his older brother Rex were both adopted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49264\" href=\"/pops-racer/4005-49264/\" slug=\"pops-racer\">   Pops Racer</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49265\" href=\"/mom-racer/4005-49265/\" slug=\"mom-racer\">   Mom Racer</a> (younger brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49266\" href=\"/spritle/4005-49266/\" slug=\"spritle\">   Spritle</a> was also adopted and seems not to be of blood relation to Speed or Rex).<br/></p><p>When Speed was seventeen, Rex died driving off a cliff.  The police said that perhaps he was drinking or driving too fast.  Speed knew this couldn't be the case (it wasn't, his car was shot at and he was forced off the road).  Rex's body was burned beyond recognition and his Army dental records needed to be checked to confirm his identity (obviously a cover-up).</p><p>Pops felt as if he'd let his family down now.  He and Rex worked together to build the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56507\" href=\"/mach-five/4055-56507/\" slug=\"mach-five\"> Mach V</a>.  Pops had borrowed money from the bank in order to fund the car.  Now he would have no choice but to sell the car to pay back the bank.  He wasn't as skilled a driver as he used to be and the computer assistance in the car needs special training.<br/></p><p>Before Pops could make a move, Speed declared that he could race the Mach V.  He said that Rex taught him everything before he died.  Slightly angry at the idea of Speed risking his life, Pops went on to point out the dangers of racing and the fact that Speed was simply too young to be allowed to be a professional racer.  Again Pops says he feels as if he's failed them since he promised to provide and raise them when he adopted them.  Speed assures Pops that he didn't fail them and now he must do his part for the family.</p><p>Speed heads to the race track to talk to the race officials about being allowed to race.  He is jeered by the other racers who give him a hard time about his age and say that his brother was a drunk.  Speed begins fighting with them but is soon out numbered.  Before things could progress, the racing official known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54604\" href=\"/the-colonel/4005-54604/\" slug=\"the-colonel\">   The Colonel</a> arrives to put a stop to the violence.  He and Speed go to his office to speak.</p><p>Speed tells the Colonel and the other officials that he can race the Mach V, win, and pay back the bank.  They admire his confidence but point out that the rules state the drivers must be eighteen.  Angered, Speed tells them they're just afraid since they own race cars.  He says they know he could win and they just want to try to buy the Mach V when they are forced to sell it.  Speed leaves still determined to be a racer.</p><p>At the qualifying race, Speed jumps the Mach V onto the track when the race begins.  He manages to beat all the professional racers and set a new course record.  Speed even jumps the Mach V onto the winners stage where the officials are all standing.  They are mad at his recklessness but it's the Colonel that points out the skill he's shown.  The Colonel tells the other officials that Speed will pack in the spectators to the races and moves to allow the age requirement to be changed.<br/></p><p>Speed Racer is on his way the be the best racer there is.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Racer X</h2><p>Throughout many dangerous races, the mysterious masked racer known as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43341\" href=\"/racer-x/4005-43341/\" slug=\"racer-x\">   Racer X</a> frequently appears.  There seems to be lots of unexplained accidents whenever Racer X is in a race.  The truth is, Racer X is really Speed's older brother Rex.  Rex faked his death with the help of a government agency and is trying to fight the evil forces of the world.  His identity is a secret to protect his family.  He always shows up to make sure that Speed is safe.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Speed Racer was originally based on the Japanese cartoon Mahha GoGoGo in 1967.  There were other cartoons in 1993 and 2002. Neither could achieve the success of the original Speed Racer.</p><p>In 2008, the Wachowski Brothers directed a live action film.</p><p>Also in 2008, <b>Speed Racer: The Next Generation</b> is released by Lionsgate Entertainment.  The series takes place years after the original.  Speed is not in the picture but has two sons, Speed and X.  Both attend an older Spritle at his racing school.  The series is set to air on Nickelodeon.</p>",

He took the Mach 1 without Pops knowing. Pops was concerned when he found out. The car was still experimental and needed to be tested first. Some debris on the track caused Rex and the Mach 1 to crash. Rex made it out of the wreckage safely. When he blamed the crash on the car, Pops blew a gasket. Years of his work had been destroyed thanks to Rex. Pops decided that Rex was too immature to handle being a racer and threatened to take him off the racing team. That was fine with Rex. He decided he'd become a world champion on his own. He walked away from Pops and his family.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/598326-racerxgun3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598326\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74633123689727\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 477px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/598326-racerxgun3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598326\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/598326-racerxgun3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/598326-racerxgun3.jpg 477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" data-width=\"477\"></a></figure><p>Rex later went to work for the International Secret Police.

It was meant to be their final meeting, Speed asks Racer X point blank if he was his brother Rex. Rather than give him the answer he had been waiting for so long to hear, Racer X suckerpunches Speed in the gut and knocks him out. He then decides to give up the guise of Racer X and leaves behind his mask for Speed to find. Knowing that the honorable and great racer was his brother, Speed is left somewhat in happiness.</p><h2>In Film</h2><p>In the Speed Racer major motion picture directed by the Wachowski Brothers, Racer X is portrayed by actor Matthew Fox. In the film Rex Racer fakes his own death in a cross country race so that he can fight corruption and evil that plagues racing and the world. </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-848200\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.42395833333333\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-848200\"><img alt=\"Matthew Fox as Racer X\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 1920w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Matthew Fox as Racer X\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 1920w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 960w, https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37428/848200-2008_speed_racer_010.jpg.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Matthew Fox as Racer X</figcaption></figure><p>He undergoes plastic surgery to alter his appearance so that there is no chance people can find out who he really is when he does not have his mask on.

    "deck": "Kamui is the deciding factor of the end of the earth, with both the potential to become a destroyer or a savior of life. He is always attempting to avoid his destiny, but never will he be so lucky.",
    "description": "<p>Early Life</p><p>==========</p><p>As a child, Kamui was sent to a public school in Tokyo, where, in third grade, he met and became fast friends with Fuma and Kotori Monou, and he even asked Kotori to be his bride. When he made his proposal in third grade, Fuma made Kamui promise that he would not make Kotori cry, or else he would be beaten up. He promised his young friend with a pinky swear, and the deal was sealed. Even though, at that time, Kamui did not entirely understand marriage, his proposal had an adverse effect on Kotori, who still dreamed about him six years later.</p><p>The three friendâs happiness was cut short when Kamui and his mother move away after Kotori and Fumaâs mother, Saya, died in 1993. When Kamui asked why they had to move away, his mother told him that Kotoriâs mother had died for their sake, and that, if they didnât leave, then everyone at the shrine that Saya had lived in would eventually die.</p><p>Kamui and his mother moved to Tokyo at this age, and found themselves a new home in Okinawa. For six years, the two espers lived happily. However, at school, Kamui began to use his powers in multiple fights, becoming well known for his inhuman fighting prowess. His mother did not approve of these fights though, and constantly confronted him about it, until one day Kamui discovered his mother in a fire. She stood in the burning houses center, turning to Kamui as he attempted to reach her in the blaze. As he ran though, something held him back, and he realized that his mother was stopping him from saving her. She then reached out her hand as she told him to go and face his destiny in Tokyo, and the fire rushed upward consuming everything from Kamuiâs view except for her outstretched hand, pointing at him as his mother shouted for him to face his destiny. Kamui watched as the blaze before him took his motherâs life.</p><p>Return to Tokyo</p><p>===============</p><p>Kamui headed his motherâs advice, and in 1999, he returned to Tokyo to face his destiny. He became enrolled in one of the high schools as a freshman. On his first day, though, as he was walking to his school, He realized that he was being followed, and stopped, asking those following him if they wanted to fight him, commenting to himself how he was going to be late on his first day of school.</p><p>Four men then proceeded to attack him, but he turned, summoning a wall of energy before him, before using it to throw the four attackers against back along the street, and they looked on in shock as rocks behind lifting up next to him, creating a deadly aura around the high school student. He then through the rocks forward and the boulders struck the men who had been assaulting him, but did not notice the one at his heels. It reached forward, grabbing his leg and, with a quick pull, brought Kamui to the ground. He brought forward another boulder, sending the man to his death between the rock and a wall.</p><p>Four more men charged forward, attempting to capture Kamui, and growing tired of the fight, Kamui shot forth a blast of energy, tearing the skin from the men before him, and the men dissolved slowly into a pile of goo.</p><p>Kamui slowly moved towards the now liquefied reaching down to lift up a piece of paper that had been held in the head of the attackers. He then smiled to himself, calling the attackers Shikis, and the paper in his hand began burning as cries of pain seemed to come from it. As the paper continued to burn, it suddenly grew into a bird, and attempted to fly away, but Kamui reached forward, grabbing the birdâs talon, and bringing it down to his eye level. He then smiled menacingly, and told it:</p><p>âGo tell your boss âGive me trouble, and I will definitely kill youââ</p><p>He then opened his hand, allowing the bird to take wing and fly away from the man on the ground. He then walked passed all the rubble he had created, bending down and grabbing the bag which he had dropped at the beginning of the fight. He stood, put the bag over his shoulder, and began walking, as if nothing had interrupted his stroll to school.</p><p>He finally arrived to school (late) and walked into the courtyard when he heard from a window above him a voice saying his name, and he looked up to discover Kotori looking down at him in shock. For a second, he froze, seeing the girl he had proposed to as a child. A man appeared in the window, and Kotori turned to him for a second, and Kamui was gone before she had a chance to look back at him.</p><p>He went to hide in a cherry tree bloom behind the school, giving himself a chance to compose himself after seeing his childhood friend who he had not seen for six years. As he stood in the grove, a soccer ball landed in the grove about five feet from where he stood, and a man came into the grove, picking it up before looking over at Kamui. Kamui looked over at the man as the man said his name disbelievingly, and Kamui recognized Fuma, his other childhood friend.</p><p>Upon seeing his other friend, Kamui turned towards him and began walking briskly, but before Fuma could even say his name, Kamui had walked passed him and out of the cherry grove, leaving behind a shocked and confused Fuma.</p><p>Kamui went straight from the cherry tree grove to his new classroom, and the teacher brought him to the front of the classroom to introduce him. He looked up for a brief moment, noticing that in his class was Kotori, but he was prepared for this, and did not lose his composure in front of everyone. The teacher introduced him as the new transfer student (who happened to be late on his first day), and Kamui noticed multiple girls looking at him with love in there eyes. The teacher then told the class his name and asked him to take the empty seat next to Kotori. She attempted to say something to him, but she was interrupted by the teacherâs lesson, and both Kamui and Kotori listened to the lesson.</p><p>After class, Kotori again attempted to say something to Kamui, but was interrupted by the mass of girls who quickly gathered around him to ask him different questions. Kamui did not answer them, though, and he stood, walking passed all of the girls and out of the classroom, making his way to the roof. As he made his way upstairs, Kotori followed him, calling his name as she ran to catch up to him. He reached the top of the stairs as she reached he bottom of the flight, and he turned to look at her as he opened the door. He then walked out of the door to the fence surrounding the roof.</p><p>Kotori appeared at the door to the roof, and called to Kamui as he stared out over the city. He then, emotionlessly confronted her, saying to her:</p><p>âDonât bother me. Please donât talk to me. I am completely different from six years ago.â</p><p>He then turned towards her, grabbing onto the fence behind him. He noticed that she was hurt, but she turned, giving him a smile before she turned and ran down the stairs, leaving Kamui alone on the roof. He looked down at the ground, hurt at what he had just said, as he did not truly hate Kotori, and only wanted to distance himself from her and her brother so that they would not be hurt when he became a part of the battle for the planet.</p><p>Kamui then turned his eyes to the sky as he grabbed the fence, pulling himself to the top of said fence. He had realized he was being watched psychically by someone, and, using his powers, he attacked the psychic spy, causing the âeyesâ it was using to break. Kamui then smiled, noting how he had only been in Tokyo for one day, and had already been attacked twice. He then brought both of his hands into an X shape on his chest and said:</p><p>âMotherâ¦ I have returned. I have returned to where six years ago, you were forced to flee, taking me along. This Tokyo.â</p><p>The Battle Above the City</p><p>=========================</p><p>Kamui began walking back down the stairs from the roof when he saw a form lying on the ground, and, picking it up, realized it was Kotori. He brought her to the nurses office and placed her on the bed, the nurse watching as he did so. He then left her bed quickly, making sure she didnât see him when she woke up.</p><p>Kamui then made his way to the house he used to live in when he lived in Tokyo before. As he stared at his destination, he remembered his mother telling him that he must grow strong until he reached the promised year of 1999, when he would decide the fate of the planet. His memory then went to his motherâs death, and he began calling into the night that he would do as his mother asked. He then turned, seeing a man behind him.</p><p>The man looked at him, and said quietly how he was enraged that earlier that day, when Kamui used his power, he hadnât conjured a kekkai, a barrier between the user and the world around him, used to protect the world from the userâs powers. The man then walked towards Kamui, asking him if he really was âtheâ Kamui. Instead of responding, though, Kamui told the man to be ready to fight, and did a back flip onto a telephone pole behind him. Again, the other man asked Kamui if he really was âKamuiâ and Kamui smiled, telling him he was in fact Kamui.</p><p>Kamui shot his hand forward, firing an energy blast towards the man, destroying everything in its path. The man jumped out of the way and told Kamui to stop, since he would hurt innocent people if he did not set up a kekkai. Kamui answered him with another blast, this one making contact with the man. He was able to block the attack though, deflecting it behind him into a house. Inside of the house, a little boy could be heard telling his mom that the wall had just disappeared. The man then turned and began running, hoping to get Kamui away from innocents, and Kamui followed him.</p><p>The man finally stopped on top of an abandoned skyscraper, and turned to fight Kamui. He then said, with hatred dripping from his words that Kamui had refused to take into consideration the innocent people in the area they had started in, only for Kamui to coldly tell him that he only cared about the things that concerned him, and nothing more.</p><p>Kamui then jumped above the man, and turning, fired a blast of energy straight down upon him. The man was hit dead on, pushing him through the seven floors of the skyscraper to the bottom floor, where he laid in the rubble. Kamui then jumped down to the bottom of the building, landing on a jutting part of the building and smiling when he realized the man before him was still alive.</p><p>The man then stood, and a spiral of debris began swirling at his feet. Kamui felt a cut on his cheek, and, feeling it with his right hand, realized that the man before him was a wind manipulator, and the man fired another burst of wind, cutting open Kamuiâs stomach. He was thrown back as hit a wall, and was buried underneath the rubble the wind had picked up.</p><p>Kamui lay there, unconscious as the man closed the distance between the two, talking to himself as he came. Kamui then rose (as he was only pretending to be knocked out) and told the man that he seemed to be unable to stop talking. The two then continued their battle, the man charging towards Kamui as he swung his hand, creating a blade of wind. Kamui jumped above the man, though, landing on a pillar in the building as the man launched another attack at him. Again, Kamui dodged, making his way up to the top of the building, the man close behind him. In the manâs hands, he held a ball of air, which he prepared to use on Kamui. Both he and Kamui attacked each other at the same time, causing the roof they had landed on to be destroyed in the aftershock. As the smoke cleared, Kamui stood over the unconscious body of his opponent, victorious.</p><p>Kamui advanced on his unconscious opponent, bringing his foot to the manâs head, slamming it against the wall. He prepared to do it again, when a voice told him to stop. He turned to find, standing before him, a girl in a swirl of energy staring down at him. He asked her who she was, only for her to tell him that the fight was over, and jumped to the side of the man who Kamui had just defeated. Kamui asked her if she was taking away his âprey,â and she turned, telling him she wasnât going to fight him. He prepared to attack her, when she reached out a hand, and from her palm came a sword which she gripped, preparing to attack. She took one swing, sending Kamui flying. He then told her to wait as she brought the man to her shoulder, but she disappeared, saying they would meet again soon, and Kamui was again left alone on a rooftop.</p><p>Dreams</p><p>======</p><p>After the battle, Kamui made his way back to where he had used to live, but his injuries began plaguing him, and he found himself falling into the streets. As he fell, he used a blast at the ground to slow his decent, making the fall safe to him. He continued to make his way along on the ground, still attempting to make it home, but he began losing consciousness, his last though being of his mother.</p><p>He regained consciousness a short while later, and began attempting to stand when he heard someone shout his name. He looked over, finding, to his shock, Fuma standing there, looking at him with shock. Fuma ran over to him, lifting him onto his shoulder, but Kamui pushed him away, standing up, only for him to be in to much pain and fall. Before he hit the ground, though, Fuma reached up and grabbed his arm, pulling him up and offering to take the weak man in his arms to his house. Again, Kamui attempted to push Fuma away, but Fuma grabbed him by the shoulders and shouting at him, telling him to come to his house for medical attention. Kamui then told Fuma not to worry about him, before falling forward, and getting off one more plea to not be taken before slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p>In his sleep, Kamui appeared in a strange place where he seemed to be surrounded by water. He began looking around, and found that he was floating next to what appeared to be earth. He moved closer to the earth, and noticed that there seemed to be something inside of it. He moved even closer, and discovered that inside it was a woman, appearing to be blind. He then heard her speaking, even though her mouth wasnât moving, and she called out to him to save her. This confused him, but when he asked what he had to save, he became even more shocked when she told him he had to save the earth. The girl and the Earth then faded away into darkness.</p><p>Kamui then stood before his own childhood, watching as he, Kotori, and Fuma played as his mother watched with Saya, Fuma and Kotoriâs mother. As he looked on the scenes playing out before his eyes, he began thinking about the times that they had had, and how they were the only ones who would play with him, since he didnât even know who his father was. He remembered how they would stay out for hours at a time, usually longer then their mothers wanted, and how they would be scolded when they returned. As he stood watching, he heard a scream to his left, and recognized the voice as Kotoriâs and he turned as the scene around him changed.</p><p>As he moved towards where Kotoriâs scream had come from, a young Fuma ran passed him, calling for his sister. Fuma opened the door where Kotori was, and his eyes fell on the horrible room before him. In the middle of the room lay pieces of his mother. Her body lay against the wall, her ribs showing. From beneath her ribs were her exposed organs, blood dripping from the exposed tissue. Her arm lay next to its socket, still attached by a few loose strings of muscle. On the other side of the room lay her leg, propped up against the wall, and her other leg lay a few feet in front of the body, but the most horrible sight lay in the middle of the room. There, in the middle of the bloodstained area lay Sayaâs head, hair spread across the floor as her eyes stared blankly back at Fuma.</p><p>Fuma stared at the body pieces in horror, until Kotori cried out, saying how she was all in pieces. The child form of Fuma then moved towards Kotori, embracing her and telling her that it wasnât their mother. Kamui, seeing the pain in the two childrenâs eyes, closed his eyes and grabbed onto his arms, looking as if he was about to cry.</p><p>The scene then changed again, and Kamui stood before his mother and a younger version of himself. He watched as his mother told him that they would have to leave, and that Saya was dead. He watched as his younger self screamed in disbelief at Sayaâs death. He watched as his mother told him that, if they staid, then everyone he loved would die, and he watched as is younger self imagined all of them, and he lost control of himself. His hand clenched, and he shouted out:</p><p>âI Wonât let anyone kill them!â</p><p>His mother then turned to him, but not the child him, but the real him. The scene before him then shattered, and he stood in a barren wasteland, which was obviously Tokyo. He turned, and saw only to buildings standing: the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Government Building. He then heard the crackle of flames, and turned to discover the mother from the previous vision standing there engulfed in flames, telling him to be strong. She told him that he must live on, until the promised day of 1999. He rushed forward, attempting to save her, but, as his hands wrapped around her, her body disintegrated n his arms. As he fell to his knees in sorry, he saw something above him, and he brought his head up to look at it.</p><p>It was Kotori tied to a cross. He screamed her name, and she called to him as well, but before he could do anything, her body was torn apart, much like her motherâs, and he screamed her name one final time. He reached out his hand as her blood rained down upon him, and a pile of blood landed in his hand, and, as he watched her head hit the ground, he felt himself beginning to cry. He reached out, grabbing her disembodied head, and brought it close to his chest as he let out a scream of anguish.</p><p>As he clutched the head, it suddenly became a pile of feathers, and he heard his name being called to him. He recognized the voice as that of the girl he had seen earlier inside of the earth, and he asked her if she had shown him this dream. She told him that she had, but that it was not an illusion, but those things from his own past. He then said that Kotori was still alive, and when she told him that she was, but that that was the future, and that the only way to save her was to save the planet, he told her to shut up. He raised his hand, sending out a large amount of energy at the woman. She gave one final shout before the image which she presented to him was destroyed in his attack. He then grabbed her falling clothes, and shouted after her:</p><p>âI swear, if you lay one finger on Kotori or Fuma, Iâll kill youâ</p><p>Sorata Arisugawa</p><p>================</p><p>Kamui woke up in Kotoriâs arms, with her staring down at him. Seeing that Kamui was awake, Kotori screamed, pulling away from him, and hoping that he didnât find her strange for holding him. As she told him how Fuma had brought him there and how he had gone out to get medicine from the doctor, but she was cut off by Fumaâs arrival home. He was not alone, another boy at his heels.</p><p>The man who had accompanied Fuma then spoke up, stating how, despite Kamui being Kamui, he was still mortal, and still had human feeling, with which he could relate with. He then stated that is was a mistake to Leave Kamui alone with Kotori, who he called a beautiful girl, to which Fuma did not react so kindly. The man stated that it was only a joke, and that he should take things so seriously.</p><p>The man then began screaming, to the shock of the other three people in the room, before he stated that he was hungry, and Kotori quickly made him something to eat. The man, named Sorata Arisugawa, complimented Kotori on her cooking and saying that she was ready to be a bride (causing Kotori to think of Kamui), and Kotori quickly changed the subject, commenting on the earthquake (which had happened while Kamui was asleep, and was the cause of her holding him.) Much to her shock, though, there was no earthquake, but Kamui just stared down at the ground.</p><p>Kamui then pushed away the food that rested in front of him, and Fuma told him that he would have to eat if he wanted to keep up his strength, to which Kotori offered to cook something, and she left.</p><p>As soon as she was gone, Sorata turned back to Kamui, and told him that he should be more kind to Kotori, who had nursed him back to health with all of her heart, and he just remained cold to her. He then ended what he was saying by commenting on how quiet Kamui was.</p><p>After the man finished his meal, he asked Fuma if he could speak to Kamui alone, promising that he wouldnât try to kill him or anything. Fuma agreed to leave, telling Kamui that he would be downstairs, and that, if he needed anything, he just had to call. After Fuma had left, the man expressed annoyance at being so mistrusted, and that he wouldnât do anything to Kamui, who he called by his first name. Kamui turned his eyes to him, telling him that he didnât like being called by his first name by strangers. He then reached up, tearing off the bandage on his cheek, revealing an unscathed cheek. Despite his angry look, though, Sorata brushed it of, commenting on how different Kamui acted when neither Kotori nor Fuma were around.</p><p>Kamui then asked the man what he was there for, and when he mentioned the wind-user and the girl with the sword in her palm, Kamui burst, accusing the man of being one of them, but the man only denied Kamuiâs claims. Kamui then reached forward, grabbing the man by his shirt and asking him how he knew about the two of them, then. The man told him that he had followed him from the school, and that he was about to talk to him when he charged off to fight the wind user. He then said how he had been surprised that Kamui hadnât set up a kekkai, and Kamui asked about the kekkai, realizing that this guy had something to do with the end of the world. The man before him also realized that the man Kamui had fought had to be a part of the end of the world, since he had mentioned a kekkai. Kamui then stood, preparing to fight the man, but he declined, saying that he wasnât stupid enough to fight Kamui.</p><p>He then told Kamui that he was a priest from Kouyasan, and that, despite being a priest, he had been sent to attend a high school in the area, and telling Kamui that he would tell him the reason for this. He proceeded to tell him about Kouyasan, and how, due to the influence of Manga and video games on the world, they had been viewed as wizards until tourists began to visit the temple. He then tells him of the Stargazer, a Buddhist monk who lives there, and by using the Tantric Buddhist Astrology method, he is able to divine the future. Again, he tells Kamui that he will later tell him about the relationship between him and the old Stargazer.</p><p>A week prier to their meeting, the Stargazer had received a Gohou, the equivalent to a Shiki, that delivered the message that told the Stargazer that Kamui will return to Tokyo. He informed Sorata of this, and he was sent to Tokyo at full speed. Finally, the man turned and looked Kamui directly in the eyes, asking him why he had come back to Tokyo, stating that one of his relatives must have passed away, triggering the memory of his mother. He reached out his hand as energy began forming from it, and Sorata reached forward, attempted to stop him, only resulting in one cold response from Kamui:</p><p>âBastard, looks like you came here to die.</p><p>Sorata then shouted, telling him that he really didnât want to fight Kamui, telling Kamui that id they fought there, they would destroy the entire shrine, and that, despite not caring about Fuma, he told Kamui that he didnât want to kill the âcute girl.â Then, he told Kamui of what the Stargazer had also said, that Kamui would return without his only remaining parent, and guided by his own destiny. Again, the memory of his mother was brought up, and he remembered his motherâs horrid last words telling him to follow his destiny in Tokyo.</p><p>Kamui thought about how she had told him that he had to leave Tokyo to protect those at the shrine where Fuma and Kotori live, and how they had left before even attending Sayaâs funeral, and the last words of his mother and of the Stargazer rang through his head. Sorata then apologized to Kamui for making him relive such horrible memories, but he told him that he must hear out his story, saying that it was for the sake of the earth. Sorataâs last words rang through Kamuiâs head, and he saw in his mind the blind woman from his dreams, cradling the earth in her arms.</p><p>Loss</p><p>====</p><p>As Kamui and Sorata talked, an explosion came from outside. Kamui and Sorata turned in the direction of where the explosion had come from, the shrine, and they prepared to make there way there. As they were about to jump, Kamui felt an unearthly pain in his chest, and fell to his knees in pain. Sorata turned to him, worried, and asked if his wounds were plaguing him. Kamui hand moved to his head as he stated that it wasnât his wounds, but that something had called out to him. Sorata was shocked, and quickly asked him who had called to him. Before he could get an answer, though, another explosion broke the air, and Sorata was quickly out of the window, leaving Kamui alone.</p><p>When Kamui left and entered the temple, he discovered everyone crowded around Fumaâs father, Kyogo, covered in blood, and with a hole through his chest. Kyogo raised his blood-stained hand, pointing it at Kamui, and saying him to:</p><p>Kamuiâ¦ take backâ¦ theâ¦ <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\">Sacred Sword</a>â¦ a Kekkaiâ¦ beâ¦foreâ¦ the seven sealsâ¦ areâ¦ destroyed.â</p><p>Kyogo then turned to Fuma, and began telling him something about he and Kamuiâs relationship. As he spoke, Kamui quietly called him uncle in a shocked voice, and Kyogo finally told Fuma that he was related to Kamui in some way, but he died before he could finish what he was saying. Fuma left the shrine, but, before Kamui could leave as well, Kotori burst through the entrance, but began to fall, do to her heart condition taking effect, and Kamui reached out, catching her before she hit the ground.</p><p>It was raining at Kyogoâs funeral. As Kamui walked towards the casket, he remembered what the man had told him, and as he walked, he felt tears begin to build up in his eyes. They fell slowly down as he stood in the rain. As Kamui reached the grave, Sorata came up towards him and told him that the battle for the earth had just started, and that the reason he had been sent to Tokyo was because the Stargazer had told him that the sword would be stolen, and he was supposed to protect it.</p><p>Sorata then became a bit sad, and mentioned that he had been taken away from his parents when he was three due to the Stargazer seeing that he was one of the seven seals. Sorataâs mother had hugged Sorata until he was finally pried away from her, and the only thing that he remembers from the events is that his mother was crying. He looked up at the sky, saying that it might have been a rainy day, before bringing his hand behind his head and giving one of his happy grins as he said that he couldnât remember. He then told Kamui that he could not tell the pain of the loss which he was feeling, but that he could understand the burden of his destiny. He told Kamui that his destiny was now moving forward at full force, and that Kyogo had been killed so that the murder could take the sword, making Kamui realize that this death was all because he could receive the sword. In a fit of anger, Kamui asked Sorata who had killed his âuncle,â and Sorata told him that the stargazer had told him:</p><p>âThe <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\">Sacred Sword</a> of Kamui would be stolen by one of the seven angels. However, when it appears before Kamui once again, the Sacred Sword may have changed its appearance.</p><p>Kamui looked down at the ground, and, in a hushed tone, he told Sorata that he had come to Tokyo to take away the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\">Sacred Sword</a>, after which he planned to leave as quickly as possible in the hopes that no one he knew would become involved in his battle. Sorata then asked Kamui where he had heard of the Sacred Sword from, and then asked if Kamuiâs mother was the one who had told him. Kamui only remained silent at this comment.</p><p>Sorata then, growing aggravated that Kamui would not tell him told him that he could understand why he was so untrusting, but that the fate of the world rested on his shoulders, and that he would have to trust someone if he wished to make the right choice. A voice then agreed with Sorata from behind, and turning, they discovered a woman carrying an umbrella. The shadows from the umbrella obscured her face, allowing them to only see her lips and her jaw. She then lifted her umbrella, and Kamui recognized her as the nurse he had seen when he had found Kotori unconscious. She smiled, and confirmed what he said, much to the Sorataâs confusion.</p><p>The nurse then smiled, and reached up to her glasses, and she asked Kamui if he couldnât recognize her yet. She took off her glasses, and to the shock of Kamui, he appeared to be staring at a black-haired version of his mother.</p><p>Kamui saw before him the unbelievable resemblance between the girl before him and his mother, and he felt the words mother leave his lips, shocking Sorata that his mother could look so beautiful. The woman then laughed at the comment, and told both Sorata and Kamui that she was only 29, and would have been only 14 when Kamui was born, also assuring them that she wasnât giving birth at the age of fourteen. Kamui then asked her who she was, and, with a smile, she told him that she was his only living relative.</p><p>The Mysterious Aunt</p><p>===================</p><p>Kamui and Sorata made their way to the womanâs house, and, looking out the window, Kamui saw the ruins of his former home next to them, and began questioning why this was. He then began thinking about the woman, and he began questioning her eyes, which looked almost the exact same as his motherâs eyes. As he contemplated, though, a towel descended onto him, and he turned to see the woman, and she told him to dry off, since he seemed cold. She then offered him a cup of hot chocolate, and as he took it into his hands, he began finding an even deeper resemblance between her and his mother. She then gave Sorata a cup of hot chocolate and sat down in a chair before the both of them.</p><p>Again, she was smiling, and as she sat down, she inferred that they probably had multiple questions for her, due to her claims of being Kamuiâs only relative. Before he could stop himself, Kamui had already asked her who she was. She introduced herself as Tokiko Magami, the nurse at the high school which Kamui had transferred to. Then, she told Kamui that her elder sisterâs name was Tooru, The same name as Kamuiâs mother. Then, still smiling, she confirmed what Kamui had thought, telling him straight out that she was his aunt.</p><p>This revelation surprised Sorata and Kamui, and Kamui began to say that his mother had never mentioned her before, but his sentence was finished for him by his aunt. She then told him that the last time she had seen her sister, she had been in middle school, and that year, Tooru left the Magami Household forever. Kamui questioned the surname Magami, to which she responded that it was his motherâs maiden name. Then, Sorata spoke up, and, by realizing how the nameâs Kanji was written, he seemed to have realized who the Magamis were.</p><p>As Sorata made his revelation, Tokiko complimented him on his knowledge, and then, turning to Kamui, she asked him if his mother had ever decided to mention the Magami family. Before he could answer though, she asked him another question, if he knew about anything relating to his father. Kamui froze, as he had never known anything of his father, and Tokiko told him that she had expected that Tooru wouldnât have mentioned him, and that she had carried the information to the grave. She then grew stern, and she told Kamui that on the night before Tooru left the Magami household, she had come to her as she slept, woke her, and told her one final thing:</p><p>âI bear the child of a man. This is a child I bear for the sake of the earth.â</p><p>Just then, both of them felt a surge of energy, and realized that someone had just set up a Kekkai in the area, and they turned to discover a giant pyramid- shaped Kekkai. Tokiko then returned to her normal smile and stated that those related to Armageddon were now gathering in Tokyo. Then, as he looked over, Kamui realized that the Kekkai was centered on the shrine where he had left Kotori, and he and Sorata then began moving towards the temple.</p><p>As Kamui opened the door to the room that they were in, Tokiko turned towards him, and told him that he should return after the battle, and she would tell him about his mother and the Magami Family, and Kamuiâs destiny. Kamui then turned and rushed out of the door, closely followed by Sorata.</p><p>As Kamui and Sorata rushed to where the Kekkai had been created, they saw as it quickly shrank, and Sorata commented on it being dispelled. Kamui, not knowing what was going on, remembered the dream he had had in which Kotori was torn limb from limb. Again, he began moving, and as he reached Kotoriâs house, he saw the girl from before who had materialized the sword from her hand. She then looked in Kamuiâs direction, and he jumped in front of her, asking her why she was there. She told him that she was there to find him, causing Kamui to forcefully ask her what she meant.</p><p>Sorata then moved in between the two and told Kamui to get a hold of himself, before turning to the woman and asked her if she was the one who had created the Kekkai. She then asked if he was the person who had come from Kouyasan, and he commented on how she was one of the seven seals. She then told Sorata that there had been another of the seals there, but that he had been called away by his beeper and therefore had to leave.</p><p>Kamui then interrupted the two of them talking and asked the girl why she had interfered with him when he had fought the wind user. She turned to him and told him that the battle had already ended, and that he had no more reason to beat up his opponent. She then turned to him slowly and asked him if he had intended to kill the man, and smiling maliciously, Kamui told her:</p><p>âIâll kill anyone who screws with me, no matter who he isâ</p><p>The two then began glaring at each other before Sorata broke their mutual glare by making a comment about how beautiful people should look so angry. Then, when the girl looked over at him, he stared at her for a second before saying suddenly that he chose her.</p><p>Kamui and Sorata, as well as the girl, the moved to see if anything had happened to Kotori, but it seemed that she was in a safe state, much to Kamuiâs relief, and Sorata then turned to Kamui. In a taunting voice, he mentioned how Kamuiâs face had lost all of its color when he realized that the shrine was the location of the Kekkai, and how he had screamed out Kotoriâs name when he made the connection. He then took Kamui in one arm and told him that they had to be getting back to Tokiko Magamiâs house.</p><p>As they turned to leave, the girl who they had met, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\">Arashi Kishu</a>, commented on the name Magami, and Sorata smiled, saying how she obviously wasnât normal if she knew about that name.</p><p>The three of them then rushed back to the house, but as they approached the house, they saw it on fire. Kamui landed next to it, and Sorata told him that the seven angels had beaten them to the house. They had burned it to hide Kamuiâs past from him.</p><p>Kamui continued staring at the burning remains of his aunts house, and he remembered what she had told him about telling him about his mother and her family, and eventually, his destiny. As he continued to stare at the flames, his mind began reliving his attempt to save his mother as she burned in their house, and he felt himself moving into the blaze.</p><p>Sorata quickly grabbed him by the arm and told him to think about what he was doing, but he turned, telling him that she was still inside, and that he could save her. As he was about to attempt to go again, Arashi spoke up from behind the two, and told Kamui that there was no one inside the building. Kamui, hearing these words, asked himself if she had escaped, only for Sorata to tell him a darker outcome, she could have been taken by the Dragons of Earth.</p><p>He then told his two friends that they should be making a swift retreat, since it was around the time that the spectators and the police would be showing up, and he turned to Arashi and asked her if she would be kind enough to join Kamui and him.</p><p>Then, he turned back to Kamui, and told him that thing was presently proceeding amazingly fast. Already, the holy sword had been stolen, a preacher had been killed, and Kamuiâs only relativeâs house was now in flames, and giving a dark smile, he told Kamui that these were the starting sign of the war of the apocalypse. The three of them then left the scene, but, as they were leaving, Kamui looked back to discover a scantily clad woman staring at them from atop telephone pole. Seeing that he saw her, she smiled, and was gone.</p><p>Two Destinies</p><p>=============</p><p>When Kamui sees that the yumemi princess is Hinoto, the one who showed him Kotori's death, he becomes completely mad and tries to attack her. Sorata stops him whereas Hinoto apologizes herself and begs him to listen to her. Sorata pushes Kamui to talk to Hinoto.</p><p>Hinoto brings him in one of her vision: a ravaged Tokyo full of corpses. She shows him that this future is due to the destruction of the kekkai of Tokyo by the fight among the dragons of Heaven and the dragons of Earth. She explains that the dragons of Earth try to destroy the Earth whereas the dragons of Heaven try to save it. She tells Kamui that it is his duty to save the Earth because he is the one who has the destiny of the Earth in his hands. Hinoto reveals that Kamui means \"the one who takes the place of gods' authority\".</p><p>Kanoe enters their conversation. She explains that Kamui could means also \"the one who chase gods' authority\". She reveals also that Kamui has the choice to become a dragon of Heaven or a dragon of Earth. Kamui has two destinies. Kanoe tries to show him the other future; but Hinoto uses her powers to chase her from her vision.</p><p>Kamui wakes up. Hinoto begs him to save the Earth and become a seal. Kamui asks her to explain why she did not tell him that he has two destinies. He moves closer and closer to her. Hien and Sohi intervene to protect their mistress. Kamui drives away them and takes Hinoto by her neck. He asks her who killed his mother. She responds she committed suicide. A wind attack hurts him. It was launched by Daisuke. He argues he cannot believe that he is the real Kamui. Kamui begins to prepare an attack when an inugami, a wolf spirit, does his entrance.</p><p>Ally and Enemy</p><p>==============</p><p>Whereas Kamui observes the inugami, the inugami's owner arrives, Yuzuriha Nekoi. She asks everyone to introduce themselves. They do it, except Kamui. It is Sorata who introduces Kamui. Yuzuriha teases Kamui. Kamui decides to leave. He says he is not concerned by the \"jour de la promesse\". Daisuke upset provokes Kamui. They begin a fight when everyone falls in an illusion created by an angel. Arashi uses her saber, Sorata his electric powers and Yuzuriha transforms Inuki in a sword. Kamui, upset by this loss of time, uses his psionic powers to destroy this illusion. This mirage breaks into cherry tree petals. Hinoto understands that the illusion was created by the Sakurazukamori.</p><p>This event gives way to a massive earthquake meaning the destruction of a kekkai in Tokyo. Hinoto explains that this destruction is one sign of the destruction of Tokyo. She confirms that Kamui has two destinies. He can choose among the dragons of Earth and the dragons of Heaven. If Kamui becomes an angel, the vision of a deserted Tokyo full of corpses would come true. Hinoto begs Kamui to become a seal and with the help of the other dragons of Heaven to save the Earth. Kamui, exasperated, leave the Diet Building distressing Hinoto. Sorata reassures her telling her that Kamui has still something to protect. Whereas Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha discuss the other seals, Kamui thinks about his destiny.</p><p>The Master of Illusions</p><p>=======================</p><p>Kamui decides to go at his previous house. He is disoriented to see Kotori. Embarrassed by this situation, Kotori loses her balance. Kamui catches her just in time. More embarrassed than ever, Kotori tumbles them down. This scene reminds old memories to Kamui and Kotori. Kamui remembers the day when Kotori felt from a tree whereas Kotori remembers the day when Kamui bring her back her hat stuck in a cherry tree. She thanks him a lot to take care of her.</p><p>Kamui remembers old memories about his mother. Kamui remembers he could not save his mother, even if he is the one who could change destinies. Kamui still interrogates himself about his destiny. He could save neither the person he loves nor a distant person. He understands to be distant with persons he cares do not protect them.</p><p>As Kamui looked into Kotoriâs eyes, a single Sakura pedal floated slowly to the ground. Then, as he realized that there were no Sakura trees around, he turned as a large gust of wind brought a swirl of Sakura blossoms into view, and Arashi and Sorata disappeared as Kamui found himself and Kotori on the edge of a ledge hundreds of feet above the ground. A sudden blast of energy made its way to the two standing on the ledge, and Kamui pulled Kotori away from the blast of energy, the attack grazing his cheek and sending blood behind him, much to the horror of Kotori. Kamui then fell to his knees, bringing his hand down and summoning a burst of energy to counter the other burst. More bursts continued to follow him, and he summoned so much energy that it blew away all other attacks. A man then walked forward, clothed in an overcoat and wearing sunglasses.</p><p>He smiled as Kamui asked him if he was the one who had attacked them at the Diet Building, and he told him that he was correct. He then joked that Kamui hadnât seemed to enjoy his company, and Kamui smirked, saying:</p><p>âWhatâs her name, Hinoto, she called you the guardian of the cherry blossom burial moundâ</p><p>The manâs smile never wavered, and he mentioned how Hinoto seemed to know a bit of everything, and he held out his hand and began chanting. A swirl of energy began forming in his palm. He brought up his arm, and a giant raptor appeared above him. He sent it flying at Kamui, who summoned an energy shield to deflect the attack. The man continued to fire energy at his opponent, but Kamui was able to keep up a perfect defense. Then, firing out a powerful strike, an explosion destroyed much of the surroundings, and Kamui found himself dazed at the manâs strength. He then told Kamui that he was in a world of illusions and that the entire world was under his control. It was not a dimension at the same extent of a Kekkai, but that it was effective none the less.</p><p>Seeing the manâs continuing power, Kamui pulled Kotori into an embrace, and telling her to hold on, he summoned a wave of energy much as he had done at the Diet Building, and the Illusion around him cracked and broke. As he prepared to leave, though, the pieces of the illusion then began to reform, and the man before him happily told him that he had reinforced the illusion this time after it was easily dispelled earlier. Then, pulling out a deck of cards, the man through them into the air, and they began to swirl around him menacingly. He brought his hand forward, and in a second, all of the cards had changed into a large flock of raptors, just like the one he had summoned before.</p><p>The man then jumped at Kamui, sending his birds at him, but Kamui quickly destroyed the Shikis, and he held out his hand as energy formed in it. Kamui released his energy, but before it made contact, the manâs cards formed a pentagram before him and created a shield, deflecting the full force of Kamuiâs attack. However, it still sent him flying backwards, and his sunglasses flew off his face, revealing a glass right eye to Kamui. The one eyed man did not hesitate at the attack, though, and fired two more attacks at Kamui, and though he was able to block it, Kotori was flung from the ledge by the force of the attack. Kamui turned, and caught her by her arm, falling to his stomach to do so.</p><p>The man controlling the illusion advanced on Kamui, smiling menacingly as he told him that he would be unable to defend himself if he saved the girl. He raised his hand for the final strike, when suddenly someone called Kamuiâs name, and Kamui turned to see Fuma breaking through the barrier that the man had created. Fuma put his body in between the man in the overcoat and Kamui, and the man stared on shocked as the illusion broke down around him. The man, seeing his Illusion fall apart, decided to retreat. Only later would Kamui ever learn that his assailant was the famous <a data-ref-id=\"43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/43367/\">Sakurazukamori, Seichiro Sakurazuka</a></p><p>Kamui was the first of the two to wake up, turning to see Kotori asleep, but unharmed. His hope is then assured by Fuma, who tells him that she is unharmed, and is only unconcious. Looking towards the ground, Kamui then tells Fuma that he is sorry for putting them through all this, even though he promised to protect them. Fuma puts out a comforting hand to Kamui, but then, suddenly, is demeanor changes, and he pulls Kamui close to him and whispers quietly:</p><p>\"I am... Your...\"</p><p>However, his revelation is cut short as Kotori awakes to find the two, and quickly rushes over to Kamui, seeing the blood on his arm. This interjection seemed to snap Fuma out of his strange state. Kotori then begins to freak out at all of Kamui's wounds, but he assures her that he is fine. He then tells them that he is sorry he put them through any trouble, and stands, quickly turning to leave. However, Fuma calls to him, and asks him what happen when he left six years ago, and what is happening now. He then turns, looking at the two, and follows them back into their house.</p><p>Deaths</p><p>======</p><p>Inside of the Mono's house, Kamui goes to sit on the couch as he thinks over all that has happened since he returned to Tokyo. However, his toughts are cut short by the arrival of Fuma, telling him that Kotori is now asleep. Then, he again asks Kamui what has been going on with him. Kamui refuses to tell him, though, and stands, only to be pulled into a hug by Fuma, telling Kamui that he plans to keep his promise from six years ago, that he will always be there to protect him.</p><p>Kamui then pulls away from him, and Fuma asks if he doesn't trust him. Kamui tells him that it is more complicated then that. He tells him that he does not want the two involoved in his problem. He tells them that he wanted them to be happy forever, but whenever he got back to tokyo, their father died. Suddenly, Fuma's handgoes straight to his chin, pulling it up, and says in his strange voice yet again:</p><p>\"Kamui... They overlap... My fate and yours...Don't you see i was born for your sake... I am your...\"</p><p>However, Kamui calls his name, attempting to snap him out of this trance. Fuma then asks if he had called him, but is proved to not even remember what he had done after that, in his strange trance-like state. Before he could respond to this, though, as, as they talked, the door opened, and a bloody body fell into the room.</p><p>Kamui and Fuma then rushed to the body, and Kamui was horrified to recognize that the body was his Aunt Tokiko. He runs forward and asks what has happened to her. She then smiles at him and brings a hand to his cheek, and tells him that, being the last of the Magami family, she had to end this way. She then tells him to not call a doctor, and that the first sacred sword was destined to be taken, and that the second was to be born at the shrine through the body of a woman.</p><p>She tells Kamui that six years ago, Kamui's mother was supposed to die, but that Saya took his mother's place. Kamui then questions this, and Tokiko tells him that she is going to show him what she means. Tokiko then began to raise up into the air, her clothes tearing off, and, slowly, a sword began to tear out of her stomach, and Kamui tried to stop her, but Fuma, not knowing what is going on, hold Kamui back. Her body then tears apart, falling to the ground in pieces as the sword appears before Kamui.</p><p>Kamui bursts into tears when he sees his aunt dismembered. Once again, he could not modify the destiny of a person he loves. The spirit of Tokiko is called by the sacred sword. She comforts Kamui saying she chose this destiny and he must hide the sacred sword inside the Clamp School. She says goodbye to Kamui and her spirit disappears.</p><p>Kotori arrives and sees Tokiko's corpse. The memory of her mother's true death comes back in her mind. Kotori cannot endure this and confounds Tokiko with her mother. Kamui tries to protect her yelling to look at him. Kotori is into a trance. She dares at Tokiko's corpse. Kamui tries to stop her but Fuma blocks him. He is also into a trance. He tells Kamui there are two swords and two Kamui.</p><p>Kotori takes Tokiko's head and falls into a catatonic state. Fuma requires Kamui to choose his destiny, to choose the destiny of the Earth. Fuma uses his psionic powers on Kamui. Fuma becomes normal and Kotori wakes up. She tells them what she saw in her vision: the destruction of Nakano. An earthquake destroys a new kekkai.</p><p>Three men arrive at the Togakushi Shrine. They introduce themselves as Nokoru Imonoyama, Akira Iyuin and Takamura Suo from Clamp School. Tokiko called them to take the sacred sword and protect her at the heart of five-branch star until the \"jour de la Promesse\".</p><p>Kotori, Fuma and Kamui arrive at Clamp School. The sacred sword stolen by Nataku calls the other sacred sword. Kotori has another vision with Kakyo who explains the sacred sword lament. Kamui feels that too. He doesn't understand why there are two sacred swords. Nokoru shows him a video of Tokiko. She explains that Kamui must follow his heart before deciding to become a dragon. If he wants to protect people he loves then he must become a dragon of Heaven. And if he wants to protect the Earth then he must become a dragon of Earth.</p><p>Kamui thinks a lot about his aunt's word. It is when he sees Kotori and Fuma that he decides to protect them instead of the Earth. This declaration transforms Fuma's behavior. He attacks Kamui with telekinetic powers and tells Kamui that if Kamui is a dragon of Heaven, then he will be a dragon of Earth. Fuma catches his sister, fixes her on a cross and kills her with the sacred sword under Kamui's eye.</p><p>Spirit</p><p>======</p><p>After killing his sister, Fuma wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the sacred sword. But Kakyo takes possession of Kotori's corpse and stops him. Kotori doesn't want her brother to kill Kamui. Arashi, Sorata, Yuzuhira, Inuki, Subaru, Seiichiro and Daisuke arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the sacred sword. Kamui doesn't support the situation. Once again, a person he loves was killed.</p><p>Kamui is a catatonic state with Kotori's head in his hands. Dragons of Heaven are completely afflicted by the last events. Sorata thinks that Kamui will always stay in this state. Subaru decides to see Kamui and uses his powers to enter Kamui's spirit. Kamui tries to eject him, but Subaru succeeds to enter. He sees the death of Kotori and then he falls under the sea of tears to see the childhood of Kamui. But Fuma appears and kills the young Fuma and the young Kotori. Subaru tries to enter contact with the young Kamui.</p><p>In Kamui's spirit, Subaru succeeds to take the attention of young Kamui. He explains he knows his feelings. Subaru shows him how his sister was killed by the person he loves. He asks Kamui to do a choice. Kamui decides to come back to save Fuma. Subaru brings him to the reality.</p><p>Seal</p><p>====</p><p>Kotori was buried inside Clamp School. Kamui remembers his old memories in front of Kotori's grave. Sorata arrives, hugs Kamui and tries to comfort him. The other seals do their appearance, even Karen Kasumi. Karen introduces herself to Kamui. She delivers him Tokiko's message: to bring the sacred sword at the heart of Clamp School. It is that Nokoru, Akira and Takamura do their appearance. They will show them the emplacement to protect the sacred sword.</p><p>Nokoru, Akira, Takamura and the seven seals arrive at a fountain in the center of Clamp School. Nokoru asks Kamui to put his hand on the symbol of the school. Kamui does it and a secret passage is opened. They go in. At the approach of the zone of seal, the other sacred sword liberates itself and asks Nataku to bring it back to Kamui. Nokoru explains that Clamp School was built star-shaped to seal the sacred sword. He tells him also that Kamui must seal his sacred sword to seal the other sacred sword. Kamui remembers what Subaru said and then agrees to seal his sacred sword. Whereas Kamui seals it, Nataku steals the other one to bring it to Fuma.</p><p>Whereas the dragons of Earth bring together, Kamui decides to see Hinoto to have some answers. Kamui arrives. Hinoto brings him into a dream. Kamui asks her why his mother is dead. Hinoto shows the past. Toru requires Saya to leave Togakushi Shrine to save her life. Saya refuses saying she is ready to die for Toru. Kyogo, his husband, reveals he knows that Saya doesn't love him, but she loves Toru. Kyogo agrees to protect the sacred sword for Kamui. Fuma is present. He dares at his mother's head and leaks her blood. Hinoto reveals that Kotori's destiny was foreordained: she would be dead even if Kamui chose to be an angel. Hinoto reveals also that Toru was the kagenie of the Earth. Her death is due to global warming. It is that Kakyo appears. He shows him the two possible futures: the rebirth of the Earth in case of victory of the Dragons of Earth or the death of the Earth due to global warming in case of victory of the Dragons of Heaven. Kamui wakes up, but he still wish to bring back Fuma.</p><p>Protectors</p><p>==========</p><p>Three month had past since the seal of the sacred sword, but Kamui still has nightmares about the events happened after his return. Kamui lives with Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha. They go to Clamp School. Arashi and Sorata are worried about Kamui, but they are also wondering about the non activity of the seven angels. Kamui goes to see Kotori like everyday. Keiichi Segawa, Kamui's class representative, arrives and invites him to lunch. Kamui decides to see Subaru before. Indeed he asks him to help for his homework.</p><p>Keiichi Segawa joins Kamui and Sorata. He apologizes to disturb them. Sorata decides to let Kamui and Keiichi alone. The conversation is pleasant. Keiichi invites Kamui to dinner. He accepts. Kamui feels an earthquake. Instinctively, Keiichi protects him. He apologizes to be so rude, but he fears earthquakes. All the dragons of Heaven learn that it was Ikebukuro which was touched.</p><p>Kamui explains to Sorata that he is invited by a classmate. Sorata is happy Kamui sees persons who are not concerned by the \"jour de la promesse\". He goes and is welcomed by Keiichi's mother. Kamui, curious, asks Keiichi why his father is not there. Keiichi explains that his father died in the Nakano Sunplaza's earthquake. After the dinner, Keiichi decides to take Kamui back. When Keiichi proposes Kamui to become his friend, a new earthquake is felt. This time again, Keiichi dares at Kamui to protect him. Kamui yells Keiichi to go home. He goes to the Sunshine 60. On the roof, Kamui finds Fuma. Fuma tells him he must create a kekkai if he wants to protect people. He goes to attack him, but Fuma shows him Tomoharu Tojyo. Fuma attacks Kamui knowing he will protect the old man. Fuma is ready to finish him when Subaru arrives and creates a kekkai.</p><p>Subaru creates a kekkai. To destroy the building, the kekkai must disappear. And to make a kekkai disappear, one way is to kill the kekkai's creator. So Nataku attacks Subaru, but Subaru is too strong. Understanding that, Fuma decides to finish the battle. He fixes Kamui in the building. Then he attacks Subaru. The onmyoji dodges every attack. Moreover, he succeeds to shut Fuma up. But for Subaru, Fuma looks like Seichiro which perturb him. Fuma takes advantage of the situation. He breaks the barrier launched by Subaru and hurts him severely. Kamui doesn't support this scene, liberates himself and attacks Fuma. Fuma dodges it, but he had the time to put out Subaru's eye. The kekkai disappears and the Sunshine 60 collapses. Kamui brings Subaru at the hospital where he will be operated.</p><p>Powerlessness</p><p>=============</p><p>Arashi and Sorata visit Subaru at the hospital. Kamui is already here. Subaru lost his right eye. Kamui apologizes not to rescue Subaru sooner. Subaru reassures him telling him that is what he wants. Indeed he wants to look like Seichiro. Sorata promises to Subaru to protect Kamui.</p><p>Kamui is tired to be useless. He cannot protect correctly Subaru. Sorata, worried about Kamui, goes to his room to see him. He comforts him and succeeds to make him win back his trust in himself. Kamui goes to school passing by Kotori's grave. He learns that Keiichi lost his mother in the last earthquake. Keiichi arrives and is worried about Kamui's wound. Kamui doesn't care; he prefers to concentrate on Keiichi state. They become real friends. Kamui wants to know how to create a kekkai. Hinoto communicate by telepathy with Kamui. She apologizes to do not see what happened to Subaru. She explains it is due to Kakyo. He excuses her.</p><p>Kamui arrives at the Diet Building. Hinoto tells him the person he saved is Tomoharu Tojyo, the president of Tojyo's laboratories. She orders Daisuke to bring Kamui at Tomoharu's bedside. Kamui has an ultimate interrogation: how to create a kekkai. She responds only a dragon of Heaven knows the answer. Daisuke tells Kamui that Seiichiro explained he creates a kekkai thinking of a precious thing. Kamui apologizes about his previous behavior. Daisuke accepts it.</p><p>Kamui and Daisuke arrive at Tojyo Laboratories where Tomoharu is. He thanks Kamui to save him. Kamui asks why Fuma was there. Tomoharu explains that Sunshine 60 is a kekkai. He explains also that Nataku is a clone of his grand-daughter and his son.</p><p>Kamui sees Yuzuhira creating a kekkai and decides to join her. Kamui arrives, but it is too late. He decides to join Daisuke; but when he arrives he finds a decapitated Daisuke. Fuma is there and tells it is his wish. Kamui, upset, attacks Fuma. Arashi and Sorata decide to join them. Kamui run Fuma through his shoulder. Fuma shows him he must run him through his heart. He says he had his chance, but now it is too late. Fuma attacks Kamui and wants to finish him. Sorata and Arashi do their appearance. Sorata tries to create a kekkai. But it is too late; Shinjuku's buildings are destroying by Beast.</p><p>Conversations</p><p>=============</p><p>Kamui has a conversation with Kakyo in a dream. Kamui tells him he wants to be stronger than Fuma to bring him back. He is ready to hurt him if it is necessary because he doesn't want Fuma to continue to kill. Kakyo reveals that Fuma is the dark side of Kamui and everyone has a dark and a bright side. He says also that Kamui must be careful because one of his allies hides her dark side. Kamui asks why he tries to help him. Kakyo answers he hopes that Kotori's last message is true.</p><p>Kamui wakes up. Subaru stays at Kamui's bedside. Kamui explains his dream. He says he cannot stop to wish. Subaru comforts him telling him his sister always said a person must realize his wish to be happy. Kamui understands he needs Fuma as Subaru needs Seichiro. Arashi and Sorata arrive. Sorata says they could not find Daisuke's corpse. Kamui wants to apologize to Hinoto. He falls in a dream where he meets Hinoto. She doesn't want Kamui's apologize because she thinks she is the only responsible of Daisuke's death. Hinoto has a crisis and her behavior changes suddenly. Kamui tells him about the conversation he had with Kakyo. She responds she doesn't know what it means and disappears. Kamui wakes up worried about Hinoto's behavior.</p><p>Kamui decides to go to school. He meets Keiichi who is worried about Kamui. He is also scared at each earthquake. His wish is to have the possibility to stop earthquakes. Kamui remembers what Daisuke said about kekkai.</p><p>Questioning</p><p>===========</p><p>Even if they are worried about Yuzuhira, Sorata jokes with Kamui and Arashi. Yuzuhira meets once again Fuma. She understands quickly he is one of the dragons of Earth when he attacks a kekkai. She decides to protect people by the creation of a kekkai. Fuma is curious and wants to test Yuzuhira. He attacks but lets Yuzuhira dodges it. He sees in her mind that she wants to live. He tells her she must live if she wants to protect people. He wants to sees if her wish is sincere and tries to kill her. At this moment, a huge telekinetic attack saves Yuzuhira. It is Kamui who launched it. Kamui takes the advantage on Fuma; but his wish to not kill Fuma reverse it. Fuma tries to kill Kamui. Yuzuhira, upset to see people dying wants to be stronger. Her wish is so sincere that an Inugami born to help her. Fuma is amused to see that and decides to run away. Yuzuhira introduces the Inugami to Kamui as Inuki. She cancels her kekkai.</p><p>Yuzuhira, Kamui, Arashi and Sorata go to the Diet Building to see Hinoto. Yuzuhira tries to introduce Inuki; but the Inugami barks at her. Yuzuhira, Sorata and Arashi donât understand whereas Kamui thinks it confirms there is something wrong with Hinoto. Hinoto reveals the next target: Yasukuni Shrine. Arrived there, Sorata creates a kekkai despairing Kamui who cannot create one. When they arrive, they feel the creation of a kekkai at the Rainbow Bridge. Kamui and Arashi decide to go there whereas Yuzuhira and Sorata stay.</p><p>Kamui and Arashi arrive and see that Subaruâs kekkai dissolves. Arashi and Kamui are looking for Subaru. They find the Sakurazukamori with his heart pierced by Subaruâs hand. Because Subaruâs kekkai was dissolved, the damage caused on the bridge is real. Kamui has just the time to save Subaru before the total destruction of the Rainbow Bridge.</p><p>Kamui visits Subaru and asks if everything is ok. Subaru explains his relation he had between him and Seichiro. Seichiro requires Kamui to take a rest. Kamui lets Subaru alone. Subaru leaves them because he could not be a seal anymore.</p><p>Envies</p><p>======</p><p>Even if it is not a moment to joke, Sorata continues to tease Arashi. Nokoru put the conversation in a serious way. He explains that it is impossible to know the next target; because if they go to a kekkai, Fuma will learn by the intermediary of his Yumemi and will attack another one. Sorata to separate in three groups of two: Arashi / Yuzuhira, Sorata / Kamui, Karen / Seiichiro. Kakyo learns that through his dream and tells Fuma that the dragons of Heaven will go at Inokashira and Ginza.</p><p>Arashi creates a kekkai around Inokashira. Kamui and Sorata feel it. Kamui and Sorata are ready to go to help the girls when a huge phoenix appears. The phoenix transforms into Hinoto. She tells them to stay to protect Ginza. She reveals that Ginza will be attacked soon. Then she disappears and shows this spell is a Shiki. Kamui recognizes this Shiki. It is the same as those which reveal to be men in black. Kamui requires Sorata to create a kekkai. He is ready to create a kekkai when Kamui stops him. He wants a Buddhist kekkai and not a seal's kekkai to talk in privacy. Sorata does it. Kamui explains he was attacks by Hinoto's Shiki when he arrived at Tokyo. But he feels this is a different Hinoto, more violent and evil. Sorata launches a spell which transforms the Shiki into a goho. So they could find the truth.</p><p>Kamui is wondering about himself. Indeed every seal knows how to create a kekkai because they have something to protect. But him, even if he wants to protect Fuma, he cannot create a kekkai.</p><p>Yuzuhira and Kamui go to see Sorata. Sorata gets out of his bedroom completely worried. He did not find Arashi anywhere. In fact, Arashi left the dragons of Heaven because she lost her powers.</p><p>The seals are worried about the number of kekkai already destroyed. Kamui thinks when Kakyo showed him the two possible futures, he preferred the angel's one. Kamui decides to join Karen at Kotori's grave to change his mind. Karen is there because she buried Nataku near Kotori. Nataku died during a fight among him, Fuma, Karen and Seiichiro. She explains she considered Nataku like her child. She is sad as Fuma is. She reveals to Kamui that Fuma said the more a person is for us, the more we hurt him. Karen tells Kamui to question Fuma the next time he will see him. Kamui has come to ask a question. He asks her if Kotori's kidnappers are some men in black. She confirms it at the great despair of Kamui.</p><p>Jour de la Promesse</p><p>===================</p><p>Others kekkai are destroyed. Kamui doesn't understand why he could not change the future as his mother said. He receives the call of the sacred sword. He goes to unseal it. Kakyo tells him if he unseals the sacred sword, tragedies will come. Kamui doesn't listen to him and unseals it. The \"jour de la Promesse\" could begin. Kamui still interrogates himself about his capacity to change the future. The four remaining seals encourage him.</p><p>Suddenly, Kamui receives a vision from Hinoto which reveals Fuma killing Kanoe. Kamui questions Fuma this. Fuma doesn't want to answer. For him, whatever he will say, Kamui always thinks the same thing. Fuma launches the battle with their angels. The fight is rough. Kamui doesn't understand Fuma. Fuma responds he doesn't even know his dearest wish. Fuma continues his attack and takes the advantage. Kamui doesn't want to believe he has another wish than bring back Fuma. Subaru confirms what Fuma said. He begs Kamui to find his dearest wish. Kamui remembers what Karen said at Nataku's grave. Kamui understands what Fuma wants, but Fuma is ready to kill him.</p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>====================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Due to Kamuiâs impressive physical abilities, as well as his ability to use magic, he is capable of making leaps at a level which is physically impossible for a normal human. He is capable of jumping from the ground up to the top of a telephone pole, and perhaps higher, without any danger to himself.</p><p>Telekinetic Attack</p><p>Using the magical abilities which he was born with, Kamui is capable of manipulating his energy into a variety of attacks and defenses, ranging from creating a powerful energy shield to summoning blasts capable of decimating buildings in a single attack.</p><p>Healing</p><p>Kamui is capable of healing at a level far above those of an average human, and even above those of a normal seal. He has been able to heal himself after his stomach has been slit open in a few hours, and being able to heal minor injuries in a matter of minutes. This comes in handy when he is fighting.</p>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>===================</p><p>Sorata Arisugawa was taken from their parents when he was three-year-old. His mother cried to let her child, but it was his destiny to go at Kongobu Shrine. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43370\" href=\"/chu/4005-43370/\" slug=\"chu\">Chu</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43427\" href=\"/hoshimi/4015-43427/\" slug=\"hoshimi\">hoshimi</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43393\" href=\"/koya-mount/4020-43393/\" slug=\"koya-mount\">Koya Mount</a>, taught him Buddhism arts and sealâs art. But Chu raised him like his son too. Sorata was a joyful kid even if he knew his destiny. Indeed Chu predicted him that he would protect <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>, but he would die for the woman he would love. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Introduction</p><p>=============</p> <p>Years past, 1999 arrives; Chu sends a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43430\" href=\"/goho/4015-43430/\" slug=\"goho\">goho</a> to Sorata in order to have a talk. Chu tells Sorata that the time has come to go to Tokyo. He must join Kamui. Sorata founds Kamui, but he is fighting <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a>. After the fight, he tries to talk to a wounded Kamui, but <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> brings him at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a>. He can just wait the right moment to enter in contact with Kamui.</p><p>The events were not convenient for Sorata. But Sorata doesnât lose his day when he saw a man (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a>) on the top of a tree. After few jokes, Sorata creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> in order to fight Yuto. Yuto understands they are both concerned by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â.<br/></p><p>The fight between Sorata and Yuto begins. They introduce themselves: Sorata Arisugawa, a high school student and Yuto Kugai, a city hall official. Sorata uses his electrical power whereas Yuto counters with a weapon (a kind of whip with a saÃ¯ in each extremity). The fight is a succession of attacks, jokes and compliments until the arrival of Fuma. Sorata and Yuto are astonished because no one could enter a kekkai except those who are concerned by the âjour de la Promesseâ. Fuma, upset, thinks that Sorata and Yuto are responsible of Kamuiâs injuries. They decide to stop their fight and Sorata cancels his kekkai. There is no destruction. The Kekkai is perfect. Yuto left to go at the Yamanote line whereas Sorata tries to introduce himself to Fuma as a friend of Kamui. He also tries to explain everything about the end of the world.</p><p>Kamui wakes up under the sight of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> who just felt an earthquake. At the same moment, Fuma and Sorata arrive. Kotori is confused and Sorata doesnât help her. During the dinner, Sorata tells to talk to Kamui in privacy. Fuma and Kotori accept and let them alone. Sorata tells Kamui that he tried to contact him earlier, but he was attacked by Daisuke and Arashi before. Kamui loses his temper and asks Sorata if he is with them. Sorata explains he is a monk from Koya mount and was sent by the hoshimi of his Shrine. Indeed he called Sorata by the intermediary of a goho. The hoshimi said that Kamui would return to Tokyo.</p><p>Sorata tells Kamui that he knows Kamui lost a parent recently. Kamui, upset, attacks Sorata. But Sorata succeeds to calm down Kamui explaining that it was the hoshimi who told him about his mother. Kyogo, during this time, feels the introduction of an intruder inside his Shrine. A fight begins between the young intruder and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43359\" href=\"/kyogo-mono/4005-43359/\" slug=\"kyogo-mono\">Kyogo Mono</a>. Even if Kyogo fights with the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43435\" href=\"/ribbon/4055-43435/\" slug=\"ribbon\">ribbon</a> of the intruder is superior. Kamui and Fuma receive the call of the sword and go to the Shrine. But it was too late, the intruder kills Kyogo. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Arashi Kishu</p><p>==============</p> <p>A conversation begins between Sorata and Kamui. Sorata explains that the hoshimi told him that the sacred sword would be stolen by a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a> and that the sacred sword would be appeared to Kamui with another shape. Kamui reveals he came back to Tokyo to take in his possession the sacred sword. Sorata tells him even if he understands Kamuiâs distrusts; he must understand that he has the destiny of the Earth in his hands. A woman enters in their conversation. She is the high school nurse. She introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\">Tokiko Magami</a>, the younger sister of Kamuiâs mother. Kamui didnât know he has an aunt. Tokiko responds that her sister left home before Kamuiâs birth. She explains she and her sisters are Magamis. She reveals also that Toru explained her that Kamui is the son of a special person and he would be born for the Earth.</p><p>Kamui and Sorata feel the creation of a kekkai. They decide to go at the Togakushi Shrine and let Tokiko. She tells them to come back if they want to know more about <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43361\" href=\"/toru-shiro/4005-43361/\" slug=\"toru-shiro\">Toru Shiro</a>, Magamis and Kamuiâs destiny. Kamui and Sorata arrive and see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a>. She explains she is here for Kamui, she knows about Sorata and she tells them that another seal was there. A tension is felt between Kamui and Arashi. Sorata tries to calm them down. Also, Sorata that Arashi will be his chosen one. He invites them to go at Tokikoâs house. When they arrive, they found the house in fire. Kamui confused, assimilates this event as his mother death and tries to save her. Sorata stops him whereas Arashi explains there is nobody inside. They decide to leave the place under the sight of a woman lightly dressed.</p><p>Kamui, Sorata and Arashi are in a restaurant due to the invitation of the Koyaâs monk. Kamui, upset to lose time decides to leave them. Sorata succeeds to stop him when he says he knows something about the Magamis, Kamuiâs family. Kamui seats again and listens to Sorata. The monk from Koyaâs mount explains that each Magamiâs member is a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43424\" href=\"/kagenie/4015-43424/\" slug=\"kagenie\">kagenie</a>, a substitution doll. A Kagenie is a great magician who takes on him the misfortune of another person. Sorata finds logical that Kamuiâs mother was a Kagenie. Kamui tells them that his mother died in a fire. Arashi explains that the person associated to Toru is on fire. By this information, Sorata guesses that Arashi came from a Shrine. As the Sumeragi chief is a man. He guesses that Arashi came from the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43399\" href=\"/ise-shrine/4020-43399/\" slug=\"ise-shrine\">Ise Shrine</a>. Then suddenly Sorata looks with attention Arashiâs face and tells her again she is his chosen one. Finally, Sorata becomes serious, pays the addition and asks Arashi to lead them to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a> where the Yumemi princess lives. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Attack</p><p>=========</p> <p>When Kamui sees that the Yumemi princess is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>, the one who showed him Kotoriâs death, he becomes completely mad and tries to attack her. Sorata stops him whereas Hinoto apologizes herself and begs him to listen to her. She thanks Sorata to have protected Kamui. Moreover she tells that she is happy to meet one of the seven seals. Sorata responds that he is also glad to meet her because the hoshimi really appreciates her. She explains that due to their common destiny: to see the future. Sorata does a joke on Hinotoâs age and then he pushes Kamui to talk to Hinoto.</p><p>After this talk, an <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43426\" href=\"/inugami/4015-43426/\" slug=\"inugami\">inugami</a> does its appearance. Everyone wait the arrival of the seal who owns the inugami. Whereas Kamui observes the inugami, Sorata teases Daisuke. But he isnât in the mood to joke; he continues to think that Kamui isnât the real Kamui. Sorata contradict him saying he knows Kamui is the real Kamui because Sorata is one of the seven seals. It is at this moment that the inugamiâs owner arrives. Sheâs a fourteen-year-old teenage who introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43394\" href=\"/mitsumine-shrine/4020-43394/\" slug=\"mitsumine-shrine\">Mitsumine Shrine</a>. She apologizes to send <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, his inugami; but she didnât find the way to get down. She asks everyone to introduce themselves. They do it, except Kamui. It is Sorata who introduces Kamui. Yuzuriha teases Kamui. Kamui decides to leave. He says he isnât concerned by the âjour de la Promesseâ. Daisuke upset provokes Kamui. They begin a fight when everyone falls in an illusion created by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. Arashi uses her saber, Sorata his electric powers and Yuzuriha transforms Inuki into a sword. Kamui, upset by this loss of time, uses his telekinetic powers to destroy this illusion. This mirage breaks into cherry tree petals. Hinoto concludes that the illusion was created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a>. An earthquake is felt. Sorata protects by instinct Arashi. Kamui, exasperated, leave the Diet Building distressing Hinoto. Sorata reassures her telling her that Kamui has still something to protect. Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha discuss about the other seals.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Contacts</p><p>===========</p> <p>Sorata and Arashi decide to follow Kamui in order to protect him. Kamui goes to his previous house and finds <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a>. Just above them, Sorata and Arashi are observing them. Arashi thanks Sorata to have protected her during the earthquake. Sorata explains it was normal because she is his chosen one. Arashi interrogates him about this. Sorata explains when he was a kid the hoshimi told him his future. Sorata would be the protector of Kamui; but it is for the woman he would love that he would give his life. And Sorata decided to chose Arashi when he saw her. Arashi changes of conversation and talks about the other seals. Considering that Arashi is the hidden <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43429\" href=\"/miko/4015-43429/\" slug=\"miko\">miko</a> of Ise, Sorata is the most powerful monk from Kongobu Shrine and Yuzuriha came from Mitsumine Shrine, Sorata thinks that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> must be one of the seven seals. It is at this moment that the woman lightly dressed enters in the conversation. She explains she just left her work to bring a message to Kamui from Tokiko. She reveals she burnt Tokikoâs house at her demand. She introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a>, one of the seven seals. She tells them to say to Kamui to protect the sacred sword. She must return to her work. Sorata asks her which Shrine she comes from. Karen, amused, tells him that she comes from the Flower, lets Sorata a visit card and leaves them into a flame show. The card reveals that the Flower is a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43433\" href=\"/soaplands-of-shinjuku/4020-43433/\" slug=\"soaplands-of-shinjuku\">soaplands of Shinjuku</a>. </p><p>Kotori and Kamui fall in an illusion created by the Sakurazukamori, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a>. Sorata and Arashi could not enter in it. They must wait. Arashi and Sorata have understood they need the help of Subaru Sumeragi in order to fight the Sakurazukamori. Arashi and Sorata call the Sumeragi family chief to obtain the information about the place where Subaru is. They learn that Subaru is already in Tokyo.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Meet</p><p>========</p> <p>Days past, a new kekkai is destroyed at Nakano. Sorata, Arashi decide to find the dragon of Earth responsible of the destruction of the Sun plaza. Arashi and Sorata make their way to Nakano Sun plaza. Subaru overtakes them. Arashi and Sorata donât know him; but they suppose he is a dragon. They decide to follow him. Subaru arrives at a Nakano Sun plaza completely destroyed. He finds Seichiro who is happy to see him. Arashi and Sorata are not so far from them. A discussion begins until Subaru decides to create a kekkai in order to realize his wish. A fight begins. Arashi and Sorata understand the fighters are <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43425\" href=\"/onmyoji/4015-43425/\" slug=\"onmyoji\">onmyoji</a>; so the dragon of Earth is Seichiro Sakurazukamori and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a> is Subaru Sumeragi. The fight is intense and none of the fighters can take an advantage over his opponent. Seichiro uses a spell to disappear. Arashi and Sorata try to find him because no one could escape from a kekkai. But Subaru doesnât want to fight anymore and cancels his kekkai. He confirms he is Subaru Sumeragi to Sorata and Arashi.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Seal</p><p>=======</p> <p>The progression of the destiny continues. Tokiko sacrificed herself in order to give birth to the second sacred sword. After killing his sister, Fuma wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the sacred sword. But <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a> takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Arashi, Sorata, Yuzuriha, Inuki, Subaru, Seiichiro and Daisuke arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the sacred sword. Kamui doesnât support the situation. </p><p>Kotori was buried inside <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a>. Kamui remembers his old memories in front of Kotoriâs grave. Sorata arrives, hugs Kamui and tries to comfort him. The other seals do their appearance, even Karen Kasumi. Karen introduces herself to Kamui. She delivers him Tokikoâs message: to bring the sacred sword at the heart of Clamp School. It is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\">Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\">Suo Takamura</a> do their appearance. They will show them the emplacement to protect the sacred sword. They go and Kamui seals the sacred sword.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Worries</p><p>==========</p><p>Three month had past since the seal of the sacred sword, but Kamui still has nightmare about the events happened after his return. Kamui lives with Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha. They go to Clamp School. Arashi and Sorata are worried about Kamui, but they are also wondering about the non activity of the seven angels. </p><p>Kamui explains to Sorata that he is invited by a classmate. Sorata is happy Kamui sees persons who are not concerned by the âjour de la Promesseâ. <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a> is attacked. Subaru and Kamui intervene. Kamui cannot do anything whereas Subaru is wounded. Kamui is tired to be useless. He cannot protect correctly Subaru. Sorata, worried about Kamui, goes to his room to see him. He comforts him and succeeds to make him win back his trust in himself. </p><p>Shinjuku is attacked. Sorata and Arashi do their appearance. Sorata tries to create a kekkai. But it is too late; Shinjukuâs buildings are destroying by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43366\" href=\"/satsuki-yatoji/4005-43366/\" slug=\"satsuki-yatoji\">Satsuki Yatoji</a>. Moreover Yuzuriha disappeared.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Incapacity</p><p>============</p><p>At the Clamp School, Arashi and Sorata discuss about the next target of the dragons of Earth. Sorata changes the conversation and does a declaration of love to Arashi. He doesnât know her feelings; but he knows she appreciates him. Only the appearance of Nokoru, Akira and Suo permit Arashi to dodge to answer. Nokoru reveals they have probabilities about the future target.</p><p>Even if they are worried about Yuzuriha, Sorata jokes with Kamui and Arashi. Yuzuriha comes back and explains them everything. Yuzuriha, Kamui, Arashi and Sorata go to the Diet Building to see Hinoto. Yuzuriha tries to introduce the new Inuki; but the inugami barks at her. Yuzuriha, Sorata and Arashi donât understand whereas Kamui thinks it confirms there is something wrong with Hinoto. Hinoto reveals the next target: Yasukuni Shrine. Arrived there, Sorata creates a kekkai despairing Kamui who cannot create one. <br/></p><p>Arashi, Yuzuriha, Sorata and Kamui are worried to not see any angels when they feel the creation of a kekkai. Kamui decides to go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43398\" href=\"/rainbow-bridge/4020-43398/\" slug=\"rainbow-bridge\">Rainbow Bridge</a>. Sorata advises him to go with someone. So Arashi and Kamui go to rescue Subaru whereas Yuzuriha and Sorata stay at the Yasukuni Shrine. A new kekkai is destroyed.</p><p>Even if it isnât a moment to joke, Sorata continues to tease Arashi. Nokoru put the conversation in a serious way. He explains that it is impossible to know the next target; because if they go to a kekkai, Fuma will learn by the intermediary of his Yumemi and will attack another one. Sorata to separate in three groups of two: Arashi / Yuzuriha, Sorata / Kamui, Karen / Seiichiro. Kakyo learns that through his dream and tells Fuma that the dragons of Heaven will go at Inokashira and Ginza.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Protection</p><p>============</p> <p>Kamui and Sorata go at Ginza whereas Yuzuriha and Arashi go at Inokashira. Kamui and Sorata feel that the girls are attacked. They are ready to go to help the girls when a huge phoenix appears. The phoenix transforms into Hinoto. She tells them to stay in order to protect Ginza. She reveals that Ginza will be attacked soon. Then she disappears and shows this spell is a Shiki. Kamui recognizes this Shiki. It is the same as those to create men in black. Kamui requires Sorata to create a kekkai. He is ready to create a kekkai when Kamui stops him. He wants a Buddhist kekkai and not a sealâs kekkai in order to talk in privacy. Sorata does it. Kamui explains he was attacks by Hinotoâs Shiki when he arrived at Tokyo. But he feels this is a different Hinoto, more violent and evil. Sorata launches a spell which transforms the Shiki into a goho. So they could find the truth.</p><p>Beast launches a huge attack in order to achieve Arashi. But a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43431\" href=\"/gohodoji/4015-43431/\" slug=\"gohodoji\">gohodoji</a> appears and receives the attack instead. Kamui arrives with a badly wounded Sorata. Arashi understands that the Gohodoji belongs to Sorata. Arashi doesnât support this scene. Sorata is happy to see Arashi healthy. Kamui requires Arashi to cancel her kekkai in order to help Sorata. She does it.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>=============</p><p>Sorata is hospitalized at Clamp School. Arashi stays at Sorataâs bedside. Sorata jokes again. Arashi doesnât appreciate that. He was very lucky to survive. Sorata answers that he accepts his broken ribs, his crushed organs and the loss of his right hand because she is his chosen one. Arashi cries he doesnât considerate her feelings. Sorata apologizes of that and he understands he is just a seal for her. Arashi tells him heâs wrong. She has feelings for him. Sorata is glad to hear that, hugs her and kisses her.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Desperately Seeking Arashi</p><p>========================</p><p>Arashi wakes up in Sorataâs bed, happy but worried also. Yuzuriha and Kamui go to see Sorata. Sorata gets out of his bedroom completely worried. He didnât find Arashi anywhere. In fact, Arashi left the dragons of Heaven because she lost her powers. Indeed, a miko must be virgin to keep her powers. She decides to leave in order to protect Sorata. </p><p>Learning the truth about the dark Hinoto and Arashi, he goes to see her. He requires Hinoto to bring back Arashi. He knows she came there and Hinoto used a spell which transports Arashi into a parallel dimension. The dark Hinoto requires Hien and Sohi to protect her from Sorata. Sorata yells to let him pass. They donât accept. Sorata is ready to beat them off. <br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump<br/></p><p>Sorataâs magical abilities and his trainings with the monks have given him the ability to jump to a height that is impossible to reach by any normal human person.</p><p><br/></p><p>Electric Attack</p><p>Sorata primary way of battle is through his control of electricity, which he employs in deadly accurate attacks. He has proved to be very dangerous in his attacks, being able to take on Yuto Kigai, one of the most powerful Dragons of Earth, without much effort. </p><p><br/></p><p>Kekkai</p><p>Due to the fact That Sorata is a seal, he is able to summon a barrier that transports anyone involved in the Jour de la Promesse into a separate dimension, called a Kekkai. This keeps two combatants from injuring any innocent pedestrians. Sorataâs Kekkai takes on the form of a cube.</p><p><br/></p><p>Buddhist kekkai</p><p>Like every monk, Sorata can create a Buddhist kekkai which permits to talk in privacy.</p><p><br/></p><p>Goho</p><p>Due to his training as a monk, Sorata is able to summon a Goho, the equivalent to a Shiki. These Gohos can be used to send messages and to spy, but a more specialized version of a goho (a Gohodoji) is capable of protecting those which Sorata specifies.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>===================</p><p>Hinoto accepted very early to become a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> in order to help her country. She lost four of her five senses to receive in return the gift to see future in dreams. She kept only her sight. Her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43363\" href=\"/kanoe/4005-43363/\" slug=\"kanoe\">Kanoe</a> was upset to see her sacrifice and decided to leave her. Hinoto became quickly the yumemi of Japanese politicians and was installed underneath the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a>. </p><p>Years passed and three came at her service: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43347\" href=\"/hien/4005-43347/\" slug=\"hien\">Hien</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43348\" href=\"/sohi/4005-43348/\" slug=\"sohi\">Sohi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a>. When Hinoto learnt about the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â, she decided to gather the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a> together. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a> was the first seal to join her. But by her wish to be good, she split her spirit in two; she created a dark Hinoto. The more Hinoto tried to be good, the more the dark Hinoto gained partially the control of Hinotoâs body.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Observation</p><p>===================</p> <p>When Hinoto sees in a dream the return of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>, she sends Daisuke and Arashi to have an eye on him and to be sure he is the real Kamui. But the dark doesnât want the victory of the seven seals. So the dark Hinoto launches <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43423\" href=\"/shiki/4015-43423/\" slug=\"shiki\">shiki</a> in order to kill Kamui. They take the shape of men in black and attack Kamui. He succeeds easily to beat them all. Kamui arrives at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a> when Hinoto decides by security to launch also a vision spell on him. Kamui feels he is observed and destroys the vision spell launched by Hinoto. She is sure that this Kamui is the same Kamui that the one in is vision.</p><p>Hinoto waits the return of Arashi and Daisuke. Arashi moves instantly herself and Daisuke to Diet Building. Hien and Sohi, Hinotoâs servants, dash at Daisuke. Hinoto asks Arashi if she believes it is the real Kamui. Arashi confirms whereas Daisuke thinks the opposite. Hien and Sohi are offended that Daisuke doesnât believe in Hinotoâs visions. Hinoto stops quickly this conversation asking Hien and Sohi to take care of Daisuke. Hinoto remembers her vision of the end of the world and asks Arashi to protect Kamui, the only person who can change his destiny. Arashi retires in order to let Hinoto does her job of clairvoyant.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Attacks</p><p>===================</p> <p>Hinoto decides to have a talk with Kamui. She brings him in a dream. Firstly, she shows him his past: how he was happy with his mother and the Monos, how he discovers <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43364\" href=\"/saya-mono/4005-43364/\" slug=\"saya-mono\">Saya Mono</a> dismembered for him and his mother and how his mother died. Finally she shows him a vision where <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a> was savagely dismembered. Kamui interrogates Hinoto why she showed him that. She explains it a memory of his past and a memory of a possible future. Kamui argues to not threaten <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> and Kotori; then he hurts Hinoto and achieves this dream. Hien and Sohi, dash at a wounded Hinoto. She comforts them; she is ok.</p><p>Hinoto has another vision. She sees a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> in an egg and then she sees a second sacred sword in a mirror. To her great surprise, she sees two Kamui. Each Kamui takes a sword. One takes his sword in his left hand and angel wings grow. The other one takes his sword in his right hand and devil wings grow. They begin a fight and it is at this moment that Hinoto wakes up. Hien and Sohi are worried when they see their mistressâs face. Hinoto reassures them and asks to let Arashi notice of the theft of the sacred sword. Arashi learns from a telepathic conversation with Hinoto that the sacred sword was stolen by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a> and a seals from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43393\" href=\"/koya-mount/4020-43393/\" slug=\"koya-mount\">Koya Mount</a> is with Kamui. Hinoto requires her to protect Kamui. The dark Hinoto takes once again the control temporarily and sends shiki to attack Arashi. Arashi arrives at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a> and she meets a curious man wearing glasses. She feels something but not hostility. For security, Arashi creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>; but the man wearing glasses is still there. Arashi uses her saber to fight them whereas the man wearing glasses uses wind attacks. After the destruction of shiki, the man introduces himself as one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Allies and Enemies</p><p>===================</p> <p>Hinoto learns that Arashi will bring Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> to her place. When Kamui sees that the yumemi princess is Hinoto, the one who showed him Kotoriâs death, he becomes completely mad and tries to attack her. Sorata stops him whereas Hinoto apologizes herself and begs him to listen to her. She thanks Sorata to have protected Kamui. Moreover she tells that she is happy to meet one of the seven seals. Sorata responds that he is also glad to meet her because the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43427\" href=\"/hoshimi/4015-43427/\" slug=\"hoshimi\">hoshimi</a> really appreciates her. She explains that due to their common destiny: to see the future. Sorata does a joke on Hinotoâs age and then he pushes Kamui to talk to Hinoto.</p><p>Hinoto brings him in one of her vision: a ravaged Tokyo full of corpses. She shows him that this future is due to the destruction of the kekkai of Tokyo by the fight between the dragons of Heaven and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. She explains that the dragons of Earth try to destroy the Earth whereas the dragons of Heaven try to save it. She tells Kamui that it is his duty to save the Earth because he is the one who has the destiny of the Earth in his hands. Hinoto reveals that Kamui means âthe one who takes the place of godsâ authorityâ.</p><p>This is at this time that Kanoe enters in their conversation. She explains that Kamui could means also âthe one who chase godsâ authorityâ. She reveals also that Kamui has the choice to become a dragon of Heaven or a dragon of Earth. Kamui has two destinies. Kanoe tries to show him the other future; but Hinoto uses her powers to chase her from her vision. </p><p>Kamui wakes up. Hinoto begs him to save the Earth and become one of the seven seals. Kamui asks her to explain why she didnât tell him that he has two destinies. He moves closer and closer to her. Hien and Sohi intervene to protect their mistress. Kamui drives away them and takes Hinoto by her neck. He asks her who killed his mother. She responds she committed suicide. That is at this moment that a wind attack hurts him. It was launched by Daisuke. He argues he cannot believe that he is the real Kamui. Kamui begins to prepare an attack when an <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43426\" href=\"/inugami/4015-43426/\" slug=\"inugami\">inugami</a>, a wolf spirit, does his entrance. Hien and Sohi are amazed because nobody, even an inugami could enter there without permission. Hinoto explains the inugami is linked to one of the seven seals and she requires Hien and Sohi to bring the dragon of Heaven there.</p><p>The inugamiâs owner arrives. Sheâs a fourteen-year-old teenage who introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43394\" href=\"/mitsumine-shrine/4020-43394/\" slug=\"mitsumine-shrine\">Mitsumine Shrine</a>. She apologizes to send <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, his inugami; but she didnât find the way to get down. Hinoto apologises her. She asks everyone to introduce themselves. They do it, except Kamui. It is Sorata who introduces Kamui. Yuzuriha teases Kamui. Kamui decides to leave. He says he isnât concerned by the âjour de la promesseâ. Daisuke upset provokes Kamui. They begin a fight when everyone falls in an illusion created by one of the seven angels. Arashi uses her saber, Sorata his electric powers and Yuzuriha transforms Inuki into a sword. Kamui, upset by this loss of time, uses his telekinetic powers to destroy this illusion. This mirage breaks into cherry tree petals. Hinoto concludes that the illusion was created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a>.</p><p>This event gives way to a massive earthquake meaning the destruction of a kekkai in Tokyo. Hinoto explains that this destruction is one of the signs of the destruction of Tokyo. She confirms that Kamui has two destinies. He can choose between the dragons of Earth and the dragons of Heaven. If Kamui becomes one of the seven angels, the vision of a deserted Tokyo full of corpses would come true. Hinoto begs Kamui to become a seal and with the help of the other dragons of Heaven to save the Earth. Kamui, exasperated, leave the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a> distressing Hinoto. Sorata reassures her telling her that Kamui has still something to protect. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Conversations</p><p>==============</p> <p>Kotori has a vision. Hinoto sees it too. Kotori and fragments fall under the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43391\" href=\"/sea-of-tears/4020-43391/\" slug=\"sea-of-tears\">Sea of Tears</a>. She sees one of the fragments and discovers that fragments are parts of the Earth. Seven persons with huge cloak do their appearance. One of them reveals to be Kamui; but he has angel wings. She falls into his arms; but she sees in his reflect, another Kamui with devil wings who tries to save her. It is too late. The Kamui with angel wings pushes Kotori into the water. Kotori finds herself fixed on a cross. She sees another Kotori fixed too; but she is dismembered. The crosses disappear and Kotori falls on the Earth. She prefers to destroy herself instead of the Earth. Kotori and Hinoto wake up. Hinoto knows the destiny of Kotori: she will die for the Earth.</p><p>Hinoto and Kanoe discuss in Hinotoâs dream. Kanoe says that is the sakurazukamori who destroyed the Nakano Sunplaza. She explains there are two Kamui. At this moment, the vision of Kakyo comes through Hinotoâs dream. They think it is due to a yumemi, a dragon. </p><p>Kanoe shows Hinoto Kotoriâs vision she had where she dies for the Earth. Kanoe and Hinoto continue their conversation. Kanoe confirms that if Kamui has two destinies, there is only one future: the death of Kotori.</p><p>Hinoto and Kanoe have a vision where a Kamui with angel wings kills a Kamui with devil wings. When the second Kamui wakes up and kills Kotori, Hinoto is afflicted. Kakyo enters in contact with Hinoto. He tells her he knows she sees what happened before it was realized. Moreover he reveals he knows she lies to others in order to realize her wish.</p><p>Kanoe has another conversation with her sister. She scoffs at Hinoto saying that the second Kamui is awake and there is only one future. </p><p>Hinoto has a conversation with Kakyo. He reveals he knows that Hinoto brought together the dragon of Heaven in order to modify the future for her own interest. He shows him the last vision of Kotori. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Worries</p><p>==========</p> <p>Hien, Sohi and Daisuke are worried about their mistressâs health when Kamui arrives. Hinoto brings him to a dream. Kamui asks her why his mother is dead. Hinoto shows the past. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43361\" href=\"/toru-shiro/4005-43361/\" slug=\"toru-shiro\">Toru Shiro</a> requires Saya to leave Togakushi Shrine in order to save her life. Saya refuses saying she is ready to die for Toru. Kyogo, his husband, reveals he knows that Saya doesnât love him, but she loves Toru. Kyogo accepts to protect the sacred sword for Kamui. Fuma is present. He dares at his motherâs head and leaks her blood. In present time, Hinoto reveals that Kotoriâs destiny was foreordained: she would be dead even if Kamui chooses to be an angel. Hinoto reveals also that Toru was the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43424\" href=\"/kagenie/4015-43424/\" slug=\"kagenie\">kagenie</a> of the Earth. Her death is due to global warming. It is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a> appears. He shows him the two possible futures: the rebirth of the Earth in case of the victory of the Dragons of Earth or the death of the Earth due to global warming in case of the victory of the Dragons of Heaven. </p><p>The dark Hinoto takes more and more the control and stops Hinoto to reveal her dreams. Daisuke is worried about Hinoto, but he is also happy that she hadnât have visions about the âjour de la promesseâ since a long time. Then when she sees what will happen to Subaru she could says nothing. Hinoto communicates by telepathy with Kamui. She apologizes to do not see what happened to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a>. She explains it is due to Kakyo. He excuses her. Kamui arrives at the Diet Building. Hinoto tells him the person he saved is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43375\" href=\"/tomoharu-tojyo/4005-43375/\" slug=\"tomoharu-tojyo\">Tomoharu Tojyo</a>, the president of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43390\" href=\"/tojyo-pharmaceutical/4020-43390/\" slug=\"tojyo-pharmaceutical\">Tojyo Pharmaceutical</a>. She orders Daisuke to bring Kamui at Tomoharuâs bedside. Kamui has an ultimate interrogation: how to create a kekkai. She responds only a dragon of Heaven knows the answer. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Dark Side</p><p>===========</p> <p>Kakyo remembers Hinoto how Daisuke is dead. Fuma attacked Daisuke. Hinoto tried to protect him. Fuma decided to eliminate both. Daisuke sacrificed himself in order to protect his mistress. Kakyo tells her once again, she could not change the future. Kamui wants to apologize to Hinoto. He falls in a dream where he meets Hinoto. She doesnât want Kamuiâs apologize because she thinks sheâs the only responsible of Daisukeâs death. Hinoto has a crisis and her behaviour changes suddenly. Kamui tells him about the conversation he had with Kakyo. She responds she doesnât know what it means and disappears. </p><p>Hinoto has another vision of the âjour de la promesseâ. The dark Hinoto does her appearance and tells her she is wrong to believe she could change the future. Even her wishes to not reveal her visions are foreordained. Moreover she says she will take her place soon.</p><p>Hinoto sees this scene in her dream. The dark Hinoto tries to convince her to let her place in order to not suffer anymore. But Hinoto has still the force to refuse this proposition. Nevertheless she knows, due to the affliction of Daisukeâs death, the next time she sees her, the dark Hinoto will take her place.</p><p>And what will happen happens. The dark Hinoto takes the complete control of Hinotoâs body. Kanoe tries to enter into her sisterâs dream; but she cannot do anymore. The dark Hinoto doesnât want to be discovered.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Betrayal</p><p>==========</p> <p>Yuzuriha, Kamui, Arashi and Sorata go to the Diet Building to see Hinoto. Yuzuriha tries to introduce Inuki; but the inugami barks at her. Yuzuriha, Sorata and Arashi donât understand whereas Kamui thinks it confirms there is something wrong with Hinoto. The dark Hinoto reveals a fake target: Yasukuni Temple. They go there. Hinoto is happy to see her plan realized. Subaru arrives at the Diet Building at her request. She tells him that the next target is the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43398\" href=\"/rainbow-bridge/4020-43398/\" slug=\"rainbow-bridge\">Rainbow Bridge</a>. Subaru decides to go alone at the great pleasure of Hinoto.</p><p>The dark Hinoto is amused by the situation whereas the real Hinoto asks Kakyo to stop the other Hinoto. Kakyo responds it is impossible because the destiny is foreordained. Subaru kills <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a> and stops to be a seal anymore. The dark Hinoto sees the departure of Subaru and prepares the next plan to destroy another dragon of Heaven.</p><p>Dark Hinoto is happy to see her yumemi coming true. The real Hinoto tries to stop her; but dark Hinoto is too strong. The real Hinoto calls her sister for help. Kanoe hears it, but thinks it is an illusion. </p><p>When the dark Hinoto sees that the seals will split in group of two persons, she is happy. She learns also that Yuzuriha and Arashi will be attack. So she sends a shiki to stop Sorata and Kamui prepared to go to help them. A huge phoenix appears in front of Kamui and Sorata. The phoenix transforms into Hinoto. She tells them to stay in order to protect Ginza. She reveals that Ginza will be attacked soon. Then she disappears and shows this spell is a shiki. </p><p>Seiichiro and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a> go to the Diet Building. The true Hinoto still tries unsuccessfully to stop the dark Hinoto. Karen and Seiichiro arrive. She tells them that the next target is Ginza. They decide to go alone at the great joy of the dark Hinoto.</p><p>Whereas the dark Hinoto sends a shiki in order to confirm the death of Karen and Seiichiro, the true Hinoto discusses with Kakyo. He doesnât understand why the dark Hinoto doesnât find the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43430\" href=\"/goho/4015-43430/\" slug=\"goho\">goho</a> sent by Sorata. Hinoto responds that the two Hinoto are linked. As the true Hinoto is hurt in her heart, the dark Hinoto is also hurt in her heart. That is why she doesnât find the goho. Kakyo advises her to be careful if she wants to not die. She answers she wants first that the seals know the truth about the dark Hinoto. Kakyo reminds her that will be difficult because the future is realizing. The only way is that Kamui finds the most cherished wish of Fuma if he wants to change the future. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Defeat</p><p>=========</p><p>When Arashi gives her virginity to Sorata, she loses her capacity to be a seal. She decides to see Hinoto. The dark Hinoto uses a massive spell to imprison Arashi in a dimension where she will be transformed into an angel.</p><p>Kakyo talks about the last events with the real Hinoto.</p><p>The dark Hinoto, observed by the goho, wants to begin the âjour de la promesseâ.<br/></p><p>Hinoto tries once again to call help from her sister. This time, Kanoe hears it and goes to Hinotoâs dream. But the dark Hinoto feels it and goes inside this dream. She reveals she is existed to Kanoe. So she must eliminate her. She uses her powers to kill Kanoe and sends a vision to seals where Fuma kills Kanoe.</p><p>The dark Hinoto thinks everything is going fine. But she doesnât see the presence of the goho. Sorata appears at the Diet Building and reveals he knows everything about the dark Hinoto. He wants she brings back Arashi. The dark Hinoto, upset by that disturbance, succeeds to convince Hien and Sohi that she is attacked by Sorata. She gives the order to attack Sorata.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>Third Eye</p><p>With her third eye, Hinoto can see the future, see peopleâs dreams, bring people into a dream, show them a vision and see everyone everywhere.</p><p><br/></p><p>Telepathy</p><p>Hinoto can communicate by telepathy with everyone.</p><p><br/></p><p>Shiki</p><p>Hinoto can create shiki which can transform into animals or persons.</p><p><br/></p><p>Immortality</p><p>Hinoto cannot grow old.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Yuto was a joyful kid who loved to be entertained. He succeeded to control quickly his powers of hydrokinesis. But he didnât use it due to his laziness. His sister Tomoe Ozaka didnât help him to stay on the straight line. By his laziness, Yuto decided to become a city hall official. It was there he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43363\" href=\"/kanoe/4005-43363/\" slug=\"kanoe\">Kanoe</a>. She tried to bring together the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. Curious he accepted to join her. They became quickly sex partners. </p><p>Time elapsed; Yuto meets another <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43366\" href=\"/satsuki-yatoji/4005-43366/\" slug=\"satsuki-yatoji\">Satsuki Yatoji</a>. He really appreciates her and enjoys spending time with her. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Test</p><p>=======</p> <p>When he learns the return of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>, Yuto decides to have a look on him. He meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a>, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a>. Curious to see a man on the top of a tree, Sorata begins to discuss with Yuto. After few jokes, Sorata creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> in order to fight Yuto. Yuto understands they are both concerned by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â.<br/></p><p>The fight between Sorata and Yuto begins. They introduce themselves: Sorata Arisugawa, a high school student and Yuto Kigai, a city hall official. Sorata uses his electrical power whereas Yuto counters with a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43405\" href=\"/yuto-kigais-weapon/4055-43405/\" slug=\"yuto-kigais-weapon\">Yuto Kigai's weapon</a> (a kind of whip with a saÃ¯ in each extremity). The fight is a succession of attacks, jokes and compliments until the arrival of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a>. Sorata and Yuto are astonished because no one could enter a kekkai except those who are concerned by the âjour de la promesseâ. Fuma, upset, thinks that Sorata and Yuto are responsible of Kamuiâs injuries. They decide to stop their fight and Sorata cancels his kekkai. There is no destruction. The kekkai is perfect. Yuto left to go at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43401\" href=\"/yamanote-line/4020-43401/\" slug=\"yamanote-line\">Yamanote Line</a> whereas Sorata tries to introduce himself to Fuma as a friend of Kamui. </p><p>Kanoe receives a call from Yuto who apologizes to be late and explains he fought one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. He tells also the fight finished by a draw due to the penetration of the perfect kekkai by a student. Kanoe understands one of her sisterâs visions about the end of the world. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Laziness</p><p>===========</p> <p>On the one hand Yuto still prefer sleep with Kanoe than destroy kekkai. When Kanoe wakes up after seeing one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>âs visions, Yuto asks her if there is a problem. Kanoe reveals him that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> has been stolen. Yuto thinks it was Sorata the responsible. Satsuki arrives and contradict him. She discovered that Sorata is a monk from Koya mount, so he is one of the seven seals. Kanoe asks Satsuki to find the sacred sword. With the help of <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a> and her natural capacity to communicate with computers, she finds that the robber is a young man with a mark composed of petals on his forehead. This last information astonishes greatly Kanoe.</p><p>On the other hand Yuto still prefer stay in company of Satsuki than attack the seven seals. Yuto sees Satsuki connected to Beast in order to attack <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a>. Electrical cables attack Kotori. Just in time, she is saved by a strong man. The electrical attack continues but the man stops it with strong attacks. Underneath the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43396\" href=\"/city-hall-of-tokyo/4020-43396/\" slug=\"city-hall-of-tokyo\">City Hall of Tokyo</a>, Yuto looks at Beast when Satsuki is electrocuted. Satsuki reassures Yuto showing him she isnât injured. Yuto thinks it is a dragon of Heaven who attacked Satsuki. Kanoe arrives at this moment with her clothes completely torn. She explains she was expulsed from her sisterâs vision and the Kotoriâs savior may be a dragon of Earth. She requires Satsuki to find information about him.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Questions</p><p>============</p><p>Time elapsed; Kanoe, Yuto and Satsuki are wondering about Fuma become recently the Kamui of the Earth.</p><p>Satsuki decides to destroy Shinjuku. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a> intervenes. Yuto sees Satsuki ask Yuzuriha a question in order to disturb her: why she mustnât kill human? Yuzuriha doesnât succeed to find an answer and Satsuki beats her. Yuto joins Satsuki telling her she asks a difficult question. For Satsuki, there is no answer whereas Yuto thinks the answer is: Because some people will be sad. Beast sees this tender discussion.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Older Dragons</p><p>===============</p> <p>When Karen arrives at Yamanote line, creates a kekkai and attacks <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a>; Yuto feels it and decide to help Nataku. When he arrives he sees Karen beats easily Nataku with her pyrokinetic powers. Yuto attacks her with his hydrokinetic powers. Like before, Yuto jokes with his opponent. The fight is intense and no one take the advantage. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a> does his entrance in order to help Karen. He hurts himself his leg in order to diminish the effect of the sleeping pills that Karen gave him. Yuto proposes to cancel their fight in order to take care of their injured partner. Karen accepts the draw and disrupts her kekkai. Yuto brings back Nataku.</p><p>Yuto spends more and more time with Satsuki, at the great displeasure of Beast. Indeed Beast observes more and more Yuto.<br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Like every dragon, Yuto could jump the high of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Hydrokinesis</p><p>Yuto can create and control water.</p><p><br/></p><p>Weapon Master</p><p>Yuto prefer using a weapon instead of his hydrokinesis ability.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<br/><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Arashi Kishu was the daughter of the hidden <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43429\" href=\"/miko/4015-43429/\" slug=\"miko\">miko</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43399\" href=\"/ise-shrine/4020-43399/\" slug=\"ise-shrine\">Ise Shrine</a>. When her mother was pregnant, she left the Shrine. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43381\" href=\"/saigu-kaede/4005-43381/\" slug=\"saigu-kaede\">Saigu Kaede</a>, the mother of the Ise Shrine, tried to find her and her child. She found Arashi living in the street. Her mother was dead and she must find food to survive. Saigu brought her at Ise Shrine. For a while, Arashi didnât want to eat. She wouldnât know if she wanted to live or not. Saigu succeeded to convince her to live telling her some people love her and some others would love her. She had the right to love and to be loved. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Observation</p><p>=============</p> <p>Years past, Saigu taught Arashi how to use her hidden miko abilities and her duty as seal. She joined <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a> at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a> in order to realize her destiny. When Hinoto sees in a dream the return of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>, she sends <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> and Arashi to have an eye on him and to be sure he is the real Kamui. She continually observes him, even when Daisuke decides to fight him. The fight is severe. Even if Daisuke succeeds to injure Kamui with a wind attack, Kamui give him a thrashing. Kamui decides to achieve Daisuke but he is interrupted by Arashi. Kamui, upset, attacks Arashi. But a saber comes through her hand and Arashi beets him off. She vanishes with Daisuke.</p><p>She moves instantly herself and Daisuke to the place where Hinoto lives. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43347\" href=\"/hien/4005-43347/\" slug=\"hien\">Hien</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43348\" href=\"/sohi/4005-43348/\" slug=\"sohi\">Sohi</a>, Hinotoâs servants, dash at Daisuke. Hinoto asks Arashi if she believes it is the real Kamui. Arashi confirms whereas Daisuke thinks the opposite. Hien and Sohi are offended that Daisuke doesnât believe in Hinotoâs visions. Hinoto stops quickly this conversation asking Hien and Sohi to take care of Daisuke. Hinoto remembers her vision of the end of the world and asks Arashi to protect Kamui, the only person who can change his destiny. Arashi retires in order to let Hinoto does her job of clairvoyant downstairs the Diet Building.<br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Four Other Seals</p><p>================</p> <p>Arashi learns from a telepathic conversation with Hinoto that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> was stolen by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a> and a seals from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43393\" href=\"/koya-mount/4020-43393/\" slug=\"koya-mount\">Koya Mount</a> is with Kamui. Hinoto requires her to protect Kamui. Arashi arrives at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a> and she meets a curious man wearing glasses. She feels something but not hostility. At this moment, several men in black who reveal to be <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43423\" href=\"/shiki/4015-43423/\" slug=\"shiki\">shiki</a> make their appearance. For security, Arashi creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>; but the man wearing glasses is still there. Arashi uses her saber to fight them whereas the man wearing glasses uses wind attacks. After the destruction of Shiki, the man introduces himself as Seiichiro Aoki, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. </p><p>During this time, Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> feel the creation of the kekkai. They decide to go at the Togakushi Shrine. The man wearing glasses must go to his redaction. So he lets his umbrella and a visit card to Arashi. His name is Seiichiro Aoki. Kamui and Sorata arrive and see Arashi. She explains she is here for Kamui, she knows about Sorata and she tells them that another seal was there. A tension is felt between Kamui and Arashi. Sorata tries to calm them down. Also, Sorata that Arashi will be his chosen one. He invites them to go at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\">Tokiko Magami</a>âs house. When they arrive, they found the house in fire. Kamui confused, assimilates this event as his mother death and tries to save her. Sorata stops him whereas Arashi explains there is nobody inside. They decide to leave the place under the sight of a woman lightly dressed.</p><p>Kamui, Sorata and Arashi are in a restaurant due to the invitation of the Koyaâs monk. Kamui, upset to lose time decides to leave them. Sorata succeeds to stop him when he says he knows something about the Magamis, Kamuiâs family. Kamui seats again and listens to Sorata. The monk from Koyaâs mount explains that each Magamiâs member is a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43424\" href=\"/kagenie/4015-43424/\" slug=\"kagenie\">kagenie</a>, a substitution doll. A Kagenie is a great magician who takes on him the misfortune of another person. Sorata finds logical that Kamuiâs mother was a Kagenie. Kamui tells them that his mother died in a fire. Arashi explains that the person associated to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43361\" href=\"/toru-shiro/4005-43361/\" slug=\"toru-shiro\">Toru Shiro</a> is on fire. By this information, Sorata guesses that Arashi came from a Shrine. As the Sumeragi chief is a man. He guesses that Arashi came from the Ise Shrine. Then suddenly Sorata looks with attention Arashiâs face and tells her again she is his chosen one. Finally, Sorata becomes serious, pays the addition and asks Arashi to lead them to Diet Building where the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> princess lives. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Attack</p><p>=========</p> <p>Everyone waits for the arrival of the seal who owns the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43426\" href=\"/inugami/4015-43426/\" slug=\"inugami\">inugami</a>. It is at this moment that the inugamiâs owner arrives. Sheâs a fourteen-year-old teenage who introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43394\" href=\"/mitsumine-shrine/4020-43394/\" slug=\"mitsumine-shrine\">Mitsumine Shrine</a>. She apologizes to send <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, his inugami; but she didnât find the way to get down. She asks everyone to introduce themselves. They do it, except Kamui. It is Sorata who introduces Kamui. Yuzuriha teases Kamui. Kamui decides to leave. He says he isnât concerned by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. Daisuke upset provokes Kamui. They begin a fight when everyone falls in an illusion created by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. Arashi uses her saber, Sorata his electric powers and Yuzuriha transforms Inuki in a sword. Kamui, upset by this loss of time, uses his psionic powers to destroy this illusion. This mirage breaks into cherry tree petals. Hinoto concludes that the illusion was created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a>.</p><p>This event gives way to a massive earthquake meaning the destruction of a kekkai in Tokyo. Hinoto begs Kamui to become a seal and with the help of the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a> to save the Earth. Kamui, exasperated, leave the Diet Building distressing Hinoto. Sorata reassures her telling her that Kamui has still something to protect. Whereas Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha discuss about the other seals, Kamui thinks about his destiny.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Contacts</p><p>===========</p> <p>Sorata and Arashi decide to follow Kamui in order to protect him. Kamui goes to his previous house and finds Kotori. Just above them, Sorata and Arashi are observing them. Arashi thanks Sorata to have protected her during the earthquake. Sorata explains it was normal because she is his chosen one. Arashi interrogates him about this. Sorata explains when he was a kid the hoshimi told him his future. Sorata would be the protector of Kamui; but it is for the woman he would love that he would give his life. And Sorata decided to chose Arashi when he saw her. Arashi changes of conversation and talks about the other seals. Considering that Arashi is the hidden miko of Ise, Sorata is the most powerful monk from Kongobu Shrine and Yuzuriha came from Mitsumine Shrine, Sorata thinks that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> must be one of the seven seals. It is at this moment that the woman lightly dressed enters in the conversation. She explains she just left her work to bring a message to Kamui from Tokiko. She reveals she burnt Tokikoâs house at her demand. She introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a>, one of the seven seals. She tells them to say to Kamui to protect the sacred sword. She must return to her work. Sorata asks her which Shrine she comes from. Karen, amused, tells him that she comes from the Flower, lets Sorata a visit card and leaves them into a flame show. The card reveals that the Flower is a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43433\" href=\"/soaplands-of-shinjuku/4020-43433/\" slug=\"soaplands-of-shinjuku\">soaplands of Shinjuku</a>. </p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a> and Kamui fall in an illusion created by the Sakurazukamori, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a>. Sorata and Arashi could not enter in it. They must wait. Arashi and Sorata have understood they need the help of Subaru Sumeragi in order to fight the Sakurazukamori. Arashi and Sorata call the Sumeragi family chief to obtain the information about the place where Subaru is. They learn that Subaru is already in Tokyo.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Meet</p><p>========</p> <p>Days past, a new kekkai is destroyed at Nakano. Sorata, Arashi decide to find the dragon of Earth responsible of the destruction of the Sun plaza. Arashi and Sorata make their way to Nakano Sun plaza. Subaru overtakes them. Arashi and Sorata donât know him; but they suppose he is a dragon. They decide to follow him. Subaru arrives at a Nakano Sun plaza completely destroyed. He finds Seichiro who is happy to see him. Arashi and Sorata are not so far from them. A discussion begins until Subaru decides to create a kekkai in order to realize his wish. A fight begins. Arashi and Sorata understand the fighters are <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43425\" href=\"/onmyoji/4015-43425/\" slug=\"onmyoji\">onmyoji</a>; so the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a> is Seichiro Sakurazukamori and the dragon of Heaven is Subaru Sumeragi. The fight is intense and none of the fighters can take an advantage over his opponent. Seichiro uses a spell to disappear. Arashi and Sorata try to find him because no one could escape from a kekkai. But Subaru doesnât want to fight anymore and cancels his kekkai. He confirms he is Subaru Sumeragi to Sorata and Arashi.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Seal</p><p>=======</p><p>The progression of the destiny continues. Tokiko sacrificed herself in order to give birth to the second sacred sword. After killing his sister, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the sacred sword. But <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a> takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Arashi, Sorata, Yuzuriha, Inuki, Subaru, Seiichiro and Daisuke arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the sacred sword. Kamui doesnât support the situation. </p><p>Kotori was buried inside <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a>. Kamui remembers his old memories in front of Kotoriâs grave. Sorata arrives, hugs Kamui and tries to comfort him. The other seals do their appearance, even Karen Kasumi. Karen introduces herself to Kamui. She delivers him Tokikoâs message: to bring the sacred sword at the heart of Clamp School. It is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\">Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\">Suo Takamura</a> do their appearance. They will show them the emplacement to protect the sacred sword. They go and Kamui seals the sacred sword.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Worries</p><p>==========</p> <p>Three month had past since the seal of the sacred sword, but Kamui still has nightmare about the events happened after his return. Kamui lives with Sorata, Arashi and Yuzuriha. They go to Clamp School. Arashi and Sorata are worried about Kamui, but they are also wondering about the non activity of the seven angels. </p><p>Kamui explains to Sorata that he is invited by a classmate. Sorata is happy Kamui sees persons who are not concerned by the âjour de la Promesseâ. <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a> is attacked. Subaru and Kamui intervene. Kamui cannot do anything whereas Subaru is wounded. Kamui is tired to be useless. He cannot protect correctly Subaru. Sorata, worried about Kamui, goes to his room to see him. He comforts him and succeeds to make him win back his trust in himself. </p><p>Shinjuku is attacked. Sorata and Arashi do their appearance. Sorata tries to create a kekkai. But it is too late; Shinjukuâs buildings are destroying by Beast. Moreover Yuzuriha disappeared.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Incapacity</p><p>============</p><p>At the Clamp School, Arashi and Sorata discuss about the next target of the dragons of Earth. Sorata changes the conversation and does a declaration of love to Arashi. He doesnât know her feelings; but he knows she appreciates him. Only the appearance of Nokoru, Akira and Suo permit Arashi to dodge to answer. Nokoru reveals they have probabilities about the future target.</p><p>Even if they are worried about Yuzuriha, Sorata jokes with Kamui and Arashi. Yuzuriha comes back and explains them everything. Yuzuriha, Kamui, Arashi and Sorata go to the Diet Building to see Hinoto. Yuzuriha tries to introduce the new Inuki; but the inugami barks at her. Yuzuriha, Sorata and Arashi donât understand whereas Kamui thinks it confirms there is something wrong with Hinoto. Hinoto reveals the next target: Yasukuni Shrine. Arrived there, Sorata creates a kekkai despairing Kamui who cannot create one. <br/></p><p>Arashi, Yuzuriha, Sorata and Kamui are worried to not see any angels when they feel the creation of a kekkai. Kamui decides to go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43398\" href=\"/rainbow-bridge/4020-43398/\" slug=\"rainbow-bridge\">Rainbow Bridge</a>. Sorata advises him to go with someone. So Arashi and Kamui go to rescue Subaru whereas Yuzuriha and Sorata stay at the Yasukuni Shrine. They arrive too late; the kekkai is destroyed and Subaru is wounded.</p><p>Arashi and Sorata visit Subaru at the hospital. Kamui is already here. Subaru lost his right eye. Kamui apologizes to not rescue Subaru sooner. Subaru reassures him telling him that is what he wants. Indeed he wants to look like Seichiro. Sorata promises to Subaru to protect Kamui. </p><p>Even if it isnât a moment to joke, Sorata continues to tease Arashi. Nokoru put the conversation in a serious way. He explains that it is impossible to know the next target; because if they go to a kekkai, Fuma will learn by the intermediary of his Yumemi and will attack another one. Sorata to separate in three groups of two: Arashi / Yuzuriha, Sorata / Kamui, Karen / Seiichiro. Kakyo learns that through his dream and tells Fuma that the dragons of Heaven will go at Inokashira and Ginza.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Protection</p><p>============</p> <p>Kamui and Sorata go at Ginza whereas Yuzuriha and Arashi go at Inokashira. Arashi creates a kekkai around Inogashira. Kamui and Sorata feel it. <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a> attacks Yuzuriha and Arashi. They dodge each attack. But Yuzuriha stumbles and Beast continues to attack her. At this moment Inuki transforms itself in a huge shield in order to protect Yuzuriha. Then it transforms itself in a sword which permits to Yuzuriha to attack electrical cables. </p><p>Satsuki let Beast finish the work whereas she goes with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a>. Beast launches a huge attack in order to achieve Arashi. But a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43431\" href=\"/gohodoji/4015-43431/\" slug=\"gohodoji\">gohodoji</a> appears and receives the attack instead. Kamui arrives with a badly wounded Sorata. Arashi understands that the Gohodoji belongs to Sorata. Arashi doesnât support this scene. Sorata is happy to see Arashi healthy. Kamui requires Arashi to cancel her kekkai in order to help Sorata.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Love</p><p>========</p> <p>Sorata is hospitalized at Clamp School. Arashi stays at Sorataâs bedside. Sorata jokes again. Arashi doesnât appreciate that. He was very lucky to survive. Sorata answers that he accepts his broken ribs, his crushed organs and the loss of his right hand because she is his chosen one. Arashi cries he doesnât considerate her feelings. Sorata apologizes of that and he understands he is just a seal for her. Arashi tells him heâs wrong. She has feelings for him. Sorata is glad to hear that, hugs her and kisses her.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Betrayal</p><p>==========</p><p>Arashi wakes up in Sorataâs bed, happy but worried also. Arashi leaves the dragons of Heaven because she lost her powers. Indeed, a miko must be virgin to keep her powers. She decides to leave in order to protect Sorata. She decides to have a talk with Hinoto in order to know what to do. She arrives and tells her everything. But it is the dark Hinoto who listens to her. She launches a spell and transports Arashi into a parallel dimension where she will become a dragon of Earth.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Since Arashi has above human abilities, as well as magical powers, she is capable of making leaps which are seen as impossible. She is able to do these jumps with amazing speed and accuracy, and may sometimes seem to just appear out of nowhere.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kakushi Miko</p><p>Arashiâs experience as a Miko allows her the ability to summon a deadly sword from her hand, allowing it to appear very quickly. This sword is capable of channeling Arashiâs energy, allowing her to create amazing explosions with it. However, after she lost her virginity to Sorata, she lost the ability to summon her weapon.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kekkai</p><p>Arashi, like all other seals, is capable of making another dimension called a Kekkai which guards the outside world from any damage, and can only be entered by people involved in the Jour de la Promesse. </p><br/><p><br/></p>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>===================</p><p>Fuma was born to parents <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43359\" href=\"/kyogo-mono/4005-43359/\" slug=\"kyogo-mono\">Kyogo Mono</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43364\" href=\"/saya-mono/4005-43364/\" slug=\"saya-mono\">Saya Mono</a> in Tokyo, Japan. His father was the priest of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a>. He had a sister: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a>. Fuma had a normal life until the day he met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> in front of the Togakushi Shrine. Kamui tried to protect a dog from the rain. Fuma found them and was touched. He helped Kamui and they become friends. Since the day <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43361\" href=\"/toru-shiro/4005-43361/\" slug=\"toru-shiro\">Toru Shiro</a> introduced Kamui to the Monos, their friendship grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Everything was fine until the day his mother sacrificed herself to give birth to the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a>. She was dismembered to make sacred sword appear. Fuma and Kotori arrived and saw their mother. Fuma took Kotori over to their mother. He convinced her that her mother died from a disease.<br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Return</p><p>=========</p> <p>Six years past, Fuma and Kotori Mono became students. They have the affection of everyone. Kotori tells Fuma she dreamt that a smiling fifteen-year-old Kamui had come back to the school. Fuma sees him and goes to meet him. But Kamui doesnât pay attention to Fuma. When Fuma learns his sister is in the nursery he waits until she wakes up. They return home talking about the return of Kamui.</p><p>Fuma goes out in order to buy some stuff for his sister. He encounters Kamui, severely injured. He brings Kumui back to the Shrine to the great surprise of his father and sister. They call the doctor and Kotori decides to watch over Kamui.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Fights</p><p>=========</p> <p>A fight between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a> begins in front of Fumaâs house. Sorata creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>. The fight is a succession of attacks, jokes and compliments until the arrival of Fuma. Sorata and Yuto are astonished because no one could enter a kekkai except those who are concerned by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. Fuma, upset, thinks that Sorata and Yuto are responsible for Kamuiâs injuries. They decide to stop their fight and Sorata cancels his kekkai. There is no destruction. The kekkai was perfect. Yuto left to go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43401\" href=\"/yamanote-line/4020-43401/\" slug=\"yamanote-line\">Yamanote Line</a> whereas Sorata tries to introduce himself to Fuma as a friend of Kamui. He also tries to explain everything about the end of the world.</p><p>Kamui wakes up under the watchful sight of Kotori who just felt an earthquake. At the same moment, Fuma and Sorata arrive. Kotori is confused and Sorata doesnât help her. During the dinner, Sorata asks to talk to Kamui in private. Fuma and Kotori accept and leave them alone. </p><p>At the same moment, a storm begins above the Togakushi Shrine. Kyogo is here and remembers that the Sacred Sword is responsible for the death of his wife. Nearby, Fuma and Kotori have a conversation about Kamui. Kotori is wondering why Kamui left Tokyo six years ago. Fuma remembers the discovery of his motherâs corpse and how he tried to convince his sister that their mother died through illness. </p><p>Kyogo, during this time, feels the presense of an intruder inside his Shrine. A fight begins between the young intruder and Kyogo. Even though Kyogo fights with the Sacred Sword, the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43435\" href=\"/ribbon/4055-43435/\" slug=\"ribbon\">ribbon</a> of the intruder is superior. Kamui and Fuma receive a call from the Sacred Sword and rush to the Shrine. But it was too late, the intruder fatally injures Kyogo. He takes the sword, introduces himself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a>, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a> and runs away. Fuma rushes to his father side. It is too late, Kyogo tries to reveal the secret about the link between his son and Kamui, but he dies before ha can reveal the information.<br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Interrogation</p><p>==============</p><p>On the day of Kyogoâs funeral, Fuma remembers the events that occured before and after the death of his father: the attempt to reveal a secret about the link between Fuma and Kamui, the wish to bring back the sacred sword and the announcement to Kotori of their fatherâs death.</p><p>Fuma dreams of and meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43363\" href=\"/kanoe/4005-43363/\" slug=\"kanoe\">Kanoe</a> inside the dream. She requires him to help the Earth. She shows him his happy childhood, the death of his mother with a Kamui leeching Sayaâs head, his fatherâs death and finally Kamui killing Kotori. Kanoe explains that the death of his sister is a possible future if he doesnât kill Kamui. Fuma wakes up, troubled.</p><p>Fuma is still disoriented about the dream he had when Kotori arrives and starts worrying about her brotherâs health. They are alone now and Kotori wants to be strong from now on to help her brother. She feels she wasnât there for him at the time of the death of their parents. Fuma tries to comfort his sister saying she was the source of his courage. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Protection</p><p>============</p> <p>Days pass, Kotori goes to her periodical medical exam whereas Fuma is still wondering about his conversation with Kanoe. She falls on Kamui. Kamui still questions himself about his destiny. He could save neither the person he loves nor a distant person. He now understands that keeping people distant from himself doesn't help to protect them. At this moment, Kotori and Kamui experience an illusion. An attack is launched against them. Kamui answers with difficulty. Indeed he must protect Kotori. A man then enters, it is the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a>. A fight begins between Seichiro and Kamui. Seichiro tries to take advantage by targeting Kotori. In order to save Kotori, Kamui cannot protect himself. Seichiro tries to finish Kamui; but he is stopped by the entrance of Fuma who then reverses the attack. Seichiro then decides it wise to make himself scarce. </p><p>Kamui wakes up whereas Kotori continues to sleep. Kamuiâs wish to protect Kotori changes the intentions and opinion of Fuma towards him. Fuma tries to reveal the secret of the link between him and Kamui; but then Kotori wakes up. Fuma resunes his usual behaviour. Fuma and Kotori explain the recent sudden events to Kamui. Kamui recalls the last events and is wondering if he can protect Fuma and Kotori now that they are involved. Fuma reminds Kamui that he promised to protect him. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Trance</p><p>=========</p> <p>Fuma has another crisis. He reveals to Kamui that they have twin destinies. Then he becomes normal. Kamui doesnât have the time to think about this because a massively injured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\">Tokiko Magami</a> arrives. She explains it is too late. It is her destiny to give birth to the second Sacred Sword in the Togakushi Shrine. She is dismembered and the second Sacred Sword appears.</p><p>Kotori arrives and sees Tokikoâs corpse. The memory of her motherâs true death comes back to her. Kotori cannot endure this and confuses Tokiko with her mother. Kamui tries to protect her by yelling at her to look at him. Kotori then appears to go into a trance. She starts to approach Tokikoâs corpse. Kamui tries to stop her but Fuma blocks him. He is also in a trance. Fuma then tells Kamui that there are two swords and two Kamui's.</p><p>Fuma tells Kamui he must choose his destiny, and in so doing choose the destiny of the Earth. Fuma uses his telekinetic powers on Kamui. Fuma then becomes normal and Kotori wakes up. She tells them what she saw in her vision. An earthquake destroys a new kekkai. Every dragon and ally feels it. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Other Kamui</p><p>=================</p><p>Three men arrive at the Togakushi Shrine. They introduce themselves as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\">Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\">Suo Takamura</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a>. Tokiko called them to take the Sacred Sword and protect her at the heart of five-branch star until the âjour de la promesseâ. </p><p>Kotori, Fuma and Kamui arrive at Clamp School. The Sacred Sword stolen by Nataku calls to the other Sacred Sword. Kotori has another vision with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a> who explains the Sacred Sword lament. Kamui feels that too. He doesnât understand why there are two Sacred Swords. Nokoru shows him a video of Tokiko. She explains that Kamui must follow his heart before deciding to become a dragon. If he wants to protect people he loves then he must become a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. And if he wants to protect the Earth then he must become a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. </p><p>Kamui thinks a lot about his auntâs words. It is when he sees Kotori and Fuma that he decides to protect them instead of the Earth. This declaration transforms Fumaâs behaviour. Fuma attacks Kamui with telekinetic powers and tells Kamui that if Kamui is a dragon of Heaven, then he will be a dragon of Earth. Fuma catches his sister, fixes her on a cross and kills her with the Sacred Sword in front of Kamuiâs eyes.</p><p>After killing his sister, Fuma wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the Sacred Sword. But Kakyo takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Kotori doesnât want her brother to kill Kamui. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a>, Sorata, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the Sacred Sword. </p> <p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Seven Angels</p><p>=================</p><p>Fuma breaks into a chamber at the Four Season Hotel. It is the chamber of Kakyo who brings Fuma in a dream. Kakyo shows Fuma the message that Kotori left but Fuma doesnât care. For him, there is only one future and it is preordained. Upset, Kamui destroys the dream, catches Kakyo and leaves. </p><p>Fuma asks Kakyo what is it that he wishes. Kakyo responds by saying he wants to die. Fuma tells him he will get his wish with the âjour de la promesseâ. Fuma brings Kakyo to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43396\" href=\"/city-hall-of-tokyo/4020-43396/\" slug=\"city-hall-of-tokyo\">City Hall of Tokyo</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a> detects the arrival of Fuma and Kakyo. Beast confirms it is Kamui. Kanoe welcomes Fuma as Kamui. Fuma introduces himself and Kakyo to others. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43366\" href=\"/satsuki-yatoji/4005-43366/\" slug=\"satsuki-yatoji\">Satsuki Yatoji</a> says that the last three angels came there with the Sacred Sword.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Subaru Sumeragi</p><p>=================</p> <p>All the data about Nataku is downloaded by Beast. Fuma observes Kakyoâs visions when Nataku enters and explains the situation. Fuma explains that the seven angels are free to do whatever they want. Now he can survive without the help of Tojyo Firm. Nataku replies he wants to stay with Fuma because he reminds him of his father. </p><p>Fuma decides to help concerning the destruction of kekkai. He goes to join Nataku in attacking the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a>. His grand-father confirms that Nataku has no soul. Fuma joins them and asks Nataku to achieve <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43375\" href=\"/tomoharu-tojyo/4005-43375/\" slug=\"tomoharu-tojyo\">Tomoharu Tojyo</a>. Nataku is ready to do it but then Fuma stops him when he feels the presence of Kamui. On the roof, Kamui finds Fuma. Fuma tells him he must create a kekkai if he wants to protect people. Kamui goes to attack Fuma, but Fuma shows him Tomoharu Tojyo. Fuma attacks Kamui knowing he will protect the old man. Fuma is ready to finish off Kumui him when Sorata arrives and creates a kekkai.</p><p>Subaru creates a kekkai. To destroy the building, the kekkai must disappear. One way to destroy a kekkai is to kill the kekkaiâs creator. So Nataku attacks Subaru, but Subaru is too strong. Realizing that Subaru is too strong for Nataku to win, Fuma decides to join the battle and finish it. He fixes Kamui in the building. Then he attacks Subara. The <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43425\" href=\"/onmyoji/4015-43425/\" slug=\"onmyoji\">onmyoji</a> dodges every attack. Moreover, he succeeds to shut Fuma up. But for Subaru, Fuma looks like Seichiro which perturbs him. Fuma takes advantage of the situation. He breaks the barrier launched by Subaru and injures him severely. Kamui doesnât approve of this situation and so liberates himself and attacks Fuma. Fuma dodges the attackand while doing that had the time to put out Subaruâs eye. The kekkai disappears and the Sunshine 60 collapses. </p><p>Fuma meets Seichiro. He remarkes that the sakurazukamori was present at Ikebukuro. Seichiro understands that Fuma doesnât care about his dragons. Fuma reveals that Subaru wanted to lose his right eye in order to look like him. Subaru's real wish can only be granted by Seichiro, but Seichiro thinks otherwise. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Abilities</p><p>===========</p> <p>Kamui is tired of feeling useless. He feels he cannot adequately protect Subaru. Kamui wants to know how to create a kekkai. Fuma is happy about this because a new power for the Kamui of Heaven means a new power for the Kamui of Earth. </p><p>Yuzuriha visits Subaru, but she must leave because she has a rendezvous elsewhere. As she's leaving she runs into Fuma. She finds in him a lovely person who looks like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43373\" href=\"/kusanagi-shiyu/4005-43373/\" slug=\"kusanagi-shiyu\">Kusanagi Shiyu</a>. Inuki disagrees with her and growls. Kusanagi arrives and apologizes for being late. She was also late, so it is not important. Yuzuriha explains that she met a man who looks like him. Kusanagi replies he knows someone who looks like everyone in order to play the role the other decides. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Daisuke Saiki</p><p>==============</p> <p>Kamui and Daisuke go to visit Tomoharu Tojyo when a kekkai is attacked. Kamui decides to go. During this time, Daisuke comes across Fuma. Fuma attackes Daisuke. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a> tried to protect Daisuke. Fuma decides to eliminate them both. Daisuke sacrifices himself in order to protect his mistress. </p><p>Kamui arrives, but it is too late. He decides to join Daisuke; but when he arrives he finds a decapitated Daisuke. Fuma is there and tells him it is his wish. Kamui, upset, attacks Fuma. Arashi and Sorata decide to join them. Kamui runs Fuma through his shoulder. Fuma shows him he must run him through his heart. He says he had his chance, but now it is too late. Fuma attacks Kamui and wants to finish him. At this moment Sorata and Arashi make their appearance. Sorata tries to create a kekkai. But it is too late; Shinjukuâs buildings are destroying by Beast. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Wishes</p><p>==========</p> <p>Fuma joins Kakyo in his dream. Fuma tells him that the future must not change if Kakyo wants his wish realized. Fuma returns to reality and goes to Ebisu. He meets a little girl and begins to talk with her. He insists that she leaves this place as soon as possible. He knows she doesn't wish to die. Thinking it is rare to find someone who has this wish; Fuma destroys the Ebisuâs kekkai. Kanoe is worried about the angelsâ behaviours and has a bad feeling about Fuma. </p><p>Kanoe tries to enter into her sisterâs dream; but she cannot do so anymore. She is confused; because the only thing she wants is to prove that Hinoto is wrong. Then she could give up her duty to be a yumemi. The fact Kanoe cannot see into her sisterâs dream is because the dark side of Hinoto has taken over. She visits Kakyo in his dream and reveals to him that he was right about her and also that Hinoto was wrong. She will not be killed by Kamui and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a> will die. The entire thing is seen by Fuma.</p><p>Yuzuriha meets Fuma once again. She understands very quickly that he is one of the dragons of Earth when he attacks a kekkai. She decides to protect people by the creation of a kekkai. Fuma is curious and wants to test Yuzuriha. He attacks but lets Yuzuriha dodge it. He sees in her mind that she wants to live. He tells her she must live if she wants to protect people. He wants to sees if her wish is sincere and tries to kill her. Right at this moment, a huge telekinetic attack saves Yuzuriha. It is Kamui who launched it. Kamui gains the advantage on Fuma; but he changes his mind about wanting to kill Fuma. Fuma then tries to kill Kamui. Yuzuriha, upset to see people dying wants to be stronger. Her wish is so sincere that an inugami is born to help her. Fuma is amused to see that and decides to run away. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Dearest Wishes</p><p>================</p><p>Even though it's not a proper moment to joke, Sorata continues to tease Arashi. Nokoru turns the conversation into a serious tone. He explains that it is impossible to know the next target; because if they go to a kekkai, Fuma will learn by the intermediary of his <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> and will attack another one. Sorata decides to separate into three groups of two: Arashi / Yuzuriha, Sorata / Kamui, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a> / Seiichiro. Kakyo learns Sorata's plan through his dream and tells Fuma that the dragons of Heaven will go at Inokashira and Ginza.</p><p>Kamui is contemplating about himself. Indeed every seal knows how to create a kekkai because they have something to protect. But him, even if he wants to protect Fuma cannot seem to create a kekkai. This is seen by Fuma with the help of Kakyo. Fuma knows the solution. If Kamui cannot create kekkai it is because his dearest wish isnât to protect Fuma. He consoles Kakyo telling him he will die soon; but before that they must welcome a new angel. </p><p>Fuma joins Subaru at Seichiroâs home. Fuma apologises that Subaruâs wish wasnât realised. But he proposes to have Seichiro realize his. Fuma tells Subaru that the sakurazukamori was displeased to see Subaru wounded by a person other than him. So he wished to erase this wound. Fuma offers Subaru Seichiroâs left eye. Fuma understands Seichiroâs wish because he will do the same for Kamui. Fuma also advises Subaru that if he accepts Seichiroâs gift, he will become the new sakurazukamori.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Like a Father</p><p>==============</p><p>Karen and Seiichiro arrive at Ginza. A feeling of danger surrounds the place. Karen creates a kekkai and asks Seiichiro to do the same. She wants to be sure that the place wonât be destroyed. It is at this moment that Nataku attacks Ginza. When he sees that Karen is his opponent, Nataku is saddened. But his duty is to destroy the kekkai, so he attacks them. They dodge each attack and are wondering why Nataku keeps launching the same attack. Nataku begs Karen to leave the place. For Karen, this request is proof that Nataku has feelings for her. He explains to her that he is a clone and has always heard he has no soul and no feelings. Karen understands because she lived through the same thing with her mother. Seiichiro tries to intervene, but he is stopped by Karen. She asks Nataku if he knows what the seven angels were doing. He reveals that he had some information by Tomoharu Tojyo. He said a yumemi told him that his grand-daughter would die twice and would be concerned by the âjour de la promesseâ. That was why he asked Nataku to steal the Sacred Sword in order to be sure he would not die. Karen is happy to learn that there is a person who loves him. She asks him why he joined the dragon of Earth. He explains he wants to be with Fuma. It is another bit of proof that Nataku has feelings because he loves Fuma. It is at this moment that Fuma makes his entrance. For Karen, he looks like Seiichiro, a very dear person to her. Fuma sees that Nataku has another wish. That is why he wants to check which one is the more important. He attacks Karen, but Nataku saves her. Fuma asks Nataku to leave, but Karen tells him to follow his heart. Nakatu makes his decision, so Fuma launches a massive attack. Seiichiro dodges it, but it is the intervention of Nataku which causes Karen not to be injured. Fuma stares at them. Karen asks Nataku to let her attack Fuma, but he doesnât want her to. He knows that Karen has no chance against Fuma. He stays to protect Karen and Fuma kills him. Nataku has just enough time to say that the yumemi Tomoharu Tojyo saw was Hinoto. Karen argues with Fuma to explain this. Fuma explains that was the dearest wish of Nataku: to die for his dearest person by the person he loves. Nataku assimilates Karen as his mother and Fuma as his father. Karen doesnât understand why he killed Nataku if he knew that. Fuma thinks everyone must have their wish realised. Some people like Karen wish to die for someone, others have a different wish. For Karen, it is intolerable to kill someone. For Fuma it is necessary if they want to take care of their dearest thing. Karen becomes completely mad and attacks Fuma. But he is too strong. Fuma decides to leave in order to respect Natakuâs wish. Moreover he lets Natakuâs corpse be taken by Karen because he knows she will take care of him.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Jour de la Promesse</p><p>==================</p><p>Fuma joins Subaru, the new sakurazukamori. He is amused to see that Subaru doesnât assimilate Fuma to Seichiro anymore. For Subaru, Seichiro doesnât exist anymore. Fuma tells him Seichiro still lives in his right eye. This implies that Subaru must live if he wants that part of Seichiro to still live. Subaru asks Fuma his dearest wish. Fuma responds by saying that only Kamui could grant him his wish.</p><p>Other kekkai are destroyed. Kamui doesnât understand why he couldnât change the future as his mother said. He receives the call of the Sacred Sword. He goes to unseal it. Kakyo tells him if he unseals the Sacred Sword, tragedies will come about. Kamui doesnât listen to him and unseals it. The âjour de la promesseâ could begin. Fuma feels it and decides to fight the dragons of Heaven.</p><p>Suddenly, Kamui receives a vision from Hinoto which shows Fuma killing Kanoe. Kamui questions Fuma about this. Fuma doesnât want to answer. For him, no matter what he says Kamui always thinks the same thing. Fuma launches the battle with their angels. The fight is rough. Kamui doesnât understand Fuma. Fuma responds he doesnât even know his dearest wish. Fuma continues his attack and takes the advantage. Kamui doesnât want to believe he has another wish that brings back Fuma. Subaru confirms what Fuma said. He begs Kamui to find his dearest wish. Kamui remembers what Karen said at Natakuâs grave. Kamui understands what Fuma wants, but Fuma is ready to kill him. <br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Like every dragon, Fuma could jump the height of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Telekinesis</p><p>Fuma either can create a sphere around him and project it or he can launch a ball of energy.</p><p><br/></p><p>Healing</p><p>Even if Fuma is injured badly, he can regenerate easily.</p><p><br/></p><p>Chameleon</p><p>Fuma can look like the dearest person of anyone.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dearest Wish</p><p>Fuma can read the dearest wish of anyone.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Origin</p><p>===================</p><p>Kotori was born to parents <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43359\" href=\"/kyogo-mono/4005-43359/\" slug=\"kyogo-mono\"> Kyogo Mono</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43364\" href=\"/saya-mono/4005-43364/\" slug=\"saya-mono\"> Saya Mono</a> in Tokyo, Japan. Her father was the priest of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\"> Togakushi Shrine</a>. She had a brother: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\"> Fuma Mono</a>. She had a weak health due to her capacity to be a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\"> Yumemi</a>. When Kotori saw <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\"> Kamui Shiro</a> for the first time, she completely felt in love with him. They were two kids taking pleasure to be together. Kamui promised her to protect her. He helped her several times. </p><p>Everything was fine until the day when her mother sacrificed herself to give birth to the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\"> Sacred Sword</a>. Indeed she was dismembered to make appeared the sacred sword. Kotori arrived and see her mother. Her brother took her over their mother. He convinced her that her mother died from a disease.<br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Return</p><p>=========</p><p>Six years past, Fuma and Kotori Mono become two students. They have the affection of everyone. Kotori tells Fuma she dreamt that a smiling fifteen-year-old Kamui coming back at school. Kotori remembers her dream, looks outside and sees a Kamui identical to her dream except for the smile. Kotori understands it wasnât a dream when she sees Kamui integrates his class. She remembers the day where Kamui did the promise to never make her cry. So she decides to follow him on the roof during their break. She tries to talk to him; But Kamui argues her to not talk to him anymore. Kotori, bathed in tears, runs away. She has a heart attack and fails. </p><p>Kotori has another vision. She fells under the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43391\" href=\"/sea-of-tears/4020-43391/\" slug=\"sea-of-tears\"> Sea of Tears</a> and see Kamui playing with the ball. But it isnât a ball, it is the Earth. Kamui drops it and the Earth is shattered. This visual shock wakes her up. It is already night and Kotori is in the infirmary of her school with only her brother Fuma and the nurse <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\"> Tokiko Magami</a>. Tokiko tells her that was Kamui who brought her there. Moreover the nurse lets Tokiko goes home with her brother. During their route, they discuss about the return of Kamui.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Care</p><p>========</p> <p>Fuma goes out in order to buy some stuff for his sister. He meets Kamui, severely injured. He brings back to his Shrine to the great surprise of his father and sister. They call the doctor and Kotori decides to watch over Kamui.</p><p>Kamui wakes up under the sight of Kotori who just felt an earthquake. At the same moment, Fuma and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\"> Sorata Arisugawa</a> arrive. Kotori is confused and Sorata doesnât help her. During the dinner, Sorata tells to talk to Kamui in privacy. Fuma and Kotori accept and let them alone. </p><p>At the same moment, a storm begins above the Togakushi Shrine. Kyogo is here and remembers how the sacred sword is responsible of the death of his wife. In another place, Fuma and Kotori have a conversation about Kamui. Kotori is wondering why Kamui left Tokyo six years ago. Fuma remembers the discovery of his motherâs corpse and how he tried to convince his sister that their mother died through illness. Kyogo is killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\"> Nataku</a>.</p><p>Kotori arrives and is worried about her brotherâs health. They are alone now and Kotori wants to be strong from now on to help her brother. Indeed she wasnât there for him at the death of their parents. Fuma tries to comfort his sister saying she was the source of his courage. </p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Meetings</p><p>===========</p> <p>Days past, Kotori goes to her periodical medical visit whereas Fuma is still wondering about his conversation he had with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43363\" href=\"/kanoe/4005-43363/\" slug=\"kanoe\"> Kanoe</a>. Kotori goes through the ravaged street where Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\"> Daisuke Saiki</a> fought. Suddenly, electrical cables attack Kotori. Just in time, she is saved by a strong man. The electrical attack continues but the man stops it with strong attacks. The man tells Kotori to be careful, especially near Kamuiâs house; then he leaves jumping from roof to roof. </p><p>Kotori remembers the last events when she sees Kamuiâs house: the return of Kamui and Kamuiâs wounds. It is at this moment that Kamui does his entrance. He is disoriented to see Kotori. Embarrassed by this situation, Kotori loses her balance. Kamui catches her just in time. Most embarrassed than ever, Kotori tumbles them down. This scene reminds old memories to Kamui and Kotori. Kamui remembers the day when Kotori felt from a tree whereas Kotori remembers the day when Kamui bring her back her hat stuck in a cherry tree. She thanks him a lot to take care of her. </p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Protections</p><p>============</p> <p>Kamui still interrogates himself about his destiny. He could save neither the person he loves nor a distant person. He understands to be distant with persons he cares donât protect them. At this moment, Kotori and Kamui fall in an illusion. An attack is launched on them. Kamui answers with difficulty. Indeed he must protect Kotori. A man does his entrance. It is the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\"> sakurazukamori</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\"> Seichiro Sakurazuka</a>. A fight begins between Seichiro and Kamui. It is Seichiro who takes the advantages because he targets Kotori. In order to save Kotori, Kamui cannot protect himself. Seichiro tries to finish Kamui; but he is stopped by the entrance of Fuma and the reverse of his attack. Seichiro prefers to make himself scarce. </p><p>Kamui wakes up whereas Kotori is still asleep. Kamuiâs wish to protect Kotori changes the behaviour of Fuma. He tries to reveal the secret they link him and Kamui; but Kotori wakes up. Fuma retrieves his usual behaviour. Fuma and Kotori require explanations to Kamui. </p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Vision</p><p>=========</p> <p>Kotori has a vision. She and fragments fall under the Sea of Tears. She sees one of the fragments and discovers that fragments are parts of the Earth. Seven persons with huge cloak do their appearance. One of them reveals to be Kamui; but he has angel wings. She falls into his arms; but she sees in his reflect, another Kamui with devil wings who tries to save her. It is too late. The Kamui with angel wings pushes Kotori into the water. Kotori finds herself fixed on a cross. She sees another Kotori fixed too; but she is dismembered. The crosses disappear and Kotori falls on the Earth. She prefers to destroy herself instead of the Earth. Kotori and Hinoto wake up. Hinoto has seen Kotoriâs vision.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Trance</p><p>===================</p> <p>Fuma has another behaviour crisis. He reveals to Kamui that they have twin destinies. Then he becomes normal. Kamui doesnât have the time to think about this because a massively injured Tokiko arrives. She explains it is too late. It is her destiny to give birth of the second sacred sword in the Togakushi Shrine. She is dismembered and the second sacred sword appears.</p><p>Kotori arrives and sees Tokikoâs corpse. The memory of her motherâs true death comes back in her mind. Kotori cannot endure this and confounds Tokiko with her mother. Kamui tries to protect her yelling to look at him. Kotori is into a trance. She goes to Tokikoâs corpse. Kamui tries to stop her but Fuma blocks him. He is also into a trance. He tells Kamui there are two swords and two Kamui.</p><p>Kotori takes Tokikoâs head and falls into a catatonic state. She has another vision. She falls under the Sea of Tears and meets her mother with the appearance of a siren. Saya reveals she is a siren because she is a sinner. She accepted to do a loveless marriage for the person she loves. She accepted to die at the Togakushi Shrine instead of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43361\" href=\"/toru-shiro/4005-43361/\" slug=\"toru-shiro\"> Toru Shiro</a>. She gave birth to the sacred sword for her. She tells Kotori she will die for the person she loves. She sinks more and more; but she is saved by someone in a hospitalâs bed. He explains they are both yumemi. Kotori tries to come near him. He brings them near the sea. They introduce themselves. His name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\"> Kakyo Kuzuki</a>. His heart is dead because the person he wants to see is dead. Kotoriâs enters in harmony with Kakyoâs one. A Kamui with an angel wing and a devil wing appears. Kakyo stops this and Kamui disappears. He reveals that the twin star of Kamui will wake up soon and that a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\"> kekkai</a> in Nakano will be destroyed very soon.</p><p>Fuma requires Kamui to choose his destiny, to choose the destiny of the Earth. Fuma uses his telekinetic powers on Kamui. Fuma becomes normal and Kotori wakes up. She tells them what she saw in her vision. An earthquake destroys a new kekkai. Every dragons and allies feel it.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Inevitable Death</p><p>================</p> <p>Three men arrive at the Togakushi Shrine. They introduce themselves as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\"> Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\"> Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\"> Suo Takamura</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\"> Clamp School</a>. Tokiko called them to take the sacred sword and protect her at the heart of five-branch star until the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\"> Jour de la Promesse</a>â. </p><p>Kotori, Fuma and Kamui arrive at Clamp School. The sacred sword stolen by Nataku calls the other sacred sword. Kotori has another vision with Kakyo who explains the sacred sword laments. Kamui feels that too. </p><p>Kamui thinks a lot about his auntâs words. It is when he sees Kotori and Fuma that he decides to protect them instead of the Earth. This declaration transforms Fumaâs behaviour. He attacks Kamui with telekinetic powers and tells Kamui that if Kamui is a dragon of Heaven, then he will be a dragon of Earth. Fuma catches his sister, fixes her on a cross and kills her with the sacred sword under Kamuiâs eyes.</p><p>After killing his sister, Fuma wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the sacred sword. But Kakyo takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Kotori doesnât want her brother to kill Kamui. </p><p>Kotori does an ultimate dream with Kakyo. She explains she didnât want her brother to kill Kamui because if he did that, Fuma couldnât return to his normal behavior. She apologizes to have used Kakyo. He doesnât care because he knows he will become a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\"> Dragons of Earth</a>. He regrets to not save her. She accepted to self-sacrifice in order to protect Kamui and the Earth. Kotori must leave. Angel wings grow on her back. Kakyo is sad because he will never see Kotori anymore. She has a message for Kamui and Fuma: she loves them and the future is not foreordained. </p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>Yumemi</p><p>Kotori has the capacity to have visions of the future in her dreams.</p>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Daisuke Saiki was born in a family of kazetsukai who control the wind. In order to optimize his power, a kazetsukai must have a person you love to protect. Daisuke found his power on the person of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>. He decided to enter at her service at the age of ten.</p><p>Due to his abilities of seal, even if he hadnât a person he loved, the young man <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a>was already the best kazetsukai of his clan. That was why Daisuke admired him and spent a lot of time with his uncle. He explained how to be a good kazetsukai.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Observation</p><p>=============</p> <p>Years past, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a> joined Hinoto at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a> in order to realize her destiny. When Hinoto sees in a dream the return of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>, she sends Daisuke and Arashi to have an eye on him and to be sure he is the real Kamui. </p><p>Kamui lets his reveries when Daisuke Saiki argues him. Daisuke Saiki is one of the shadows who observed Kamui. Daisuke doesnât understand why Kamui used his powers without thinking and without making a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>. Kamui doesnât appreciate this altercation and attacks Daisuke. Daisuke doesnât want to hurt innocent people. That is why he decides to go on a top of a building where no one could be hurt. The fight is severe. Even if Daisuke succeeds to injure Kamui with a wind attack, Kamui give him a thrashing. Kamui decides to achieve Daisuke but he is interrupted by Arashi Kishu, the second shadow who observed him. Kamui, upset, attacks Arashi. But a saber comes through her hand and Arashi beets him off. </p><p>She moves instantly herself and Daisuke to the place where Hinoto lives. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43347\" href=\"/hien/4005-43347/\" slug=\"hien\">Hien</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43348\" href=\"/sohi/4005-43348/\" slug=\"sohi\">Sohi</a>, Hinotoâs servants, dash at Daisuke. Hinoto asks Arashi if she believes it is the real Kamui. Arashi confirms whereas Daisuke thinks the opposite. Hien and Sohi are offended that Daisuke doesnât believe in Hinotoâs visions. Hinoto stops quickly this conversation asking Hien and Sohi to take care of Daisuke. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Meeting</p><p>===========</p> <p>Daisuke has only a broken arm. He takes a rest when Kamui arrives to require explanation to Hinoto. He moves closer and closer to her. Hien and Sohi intervene to protect their mistress. Kamui drives away them and takes Hinoto by her neck. He asks her who killed his mother. She responds she committed suicide. That is at this moment that a wind attack hurts him. It was launched by Daisuke. He argues he cannot believe that he is the real Kamui. Kamui begins to prepare an attack when an <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43426\" href=\"/inugami/4015-43426/\" slug=\"inugami\">inugami</a>, a wolf spirit, does his entrance. Hien and Sohi are amazed because nobody, even an inugami could enter there without permission. Hinoto explains the inugami is linked to one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a> and she requires Hien and Sohi to bring the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a> there.</p><p>Everyone wait the arrival of the seal who owns the inugami. Whereas Kamui observes the inugami, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> teases Daisuke. But he isnât in the mood to joke; he continues to think that Kamui isnât the real Kamui. Sorata contradict him saying he knows Kamui is the real Kamui because Sorata is one of the seven seals. It is at this moment that the inugamiâs owner arrives. Sheâs a fourteen-year-old teenage who introduces herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43394\" href=\"/mitsumine-shrine/4020-43394/\" slug=\"mitsumine-shrine\">Mitsumine Shrine</a>. She apologizes to send <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, his inugami; but she didnât find the way to get down. She asks everyone to introduce themselves. They do it, except Kamui. It is Sorata who introduces Kamui. She asks Daisuke if he knows <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a>. Daisuke is surprised that Yuzuriha knows his uncle. She responds she met him before coming. Yuzuriha teases Kamui. Kamui decides to leave. He says he isnât concerned by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. Daisuke upset provokes Kamui. They begin a fight when everyone falls in an illusion created by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. Arashi uses her saber, Sorata his electric powers and Yuzuriha transforms Inuki in a sword. Kamui, upset by this loss of time, uses his telekinetic powers to destroy this illusion. This mirage breaks into cherry tree petals. Hinoto concludes that the illusion was created by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a>.</p><p>This event gives way to a massive earthquake meaning the destruction of a kekkai in Tokyo. Hinoto explains that this destruction is one of the signs of the destruction of Tokyo. Kamui, exasperated, leave the Diet Building distressing Hinoto. Sorata reassures her telling her that Kamui has still something to protect. Whereas Sorata, Arashi, Daisuke and Yuzuriha discuss about the other seals, Kamui thinks about his destiny.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Feelings</p><p>==========</p> <p>Yuzuriha and Daisuke have an appointment with Seiichiro when the Sunplaza is destroyed. They decide to join decide quickly Seiichiro. Daisuke and Yuzuriha arrive at Yasukuni Shrine. Seiichiro join them. Yuzuriha and Seiichiro tease Daisuke. Moreover, Seiichiro reveals he is Daisukeâs uncle. Daisuke brings them back to a serious discussion and talks about the last destroyed kekkai. </p><p>When Fuma becomes the Kamui of the Earth, the seven seals feel it. Yuzuriha, Seiichiro and Daisuke decide to go at the Clamp School. After killing his sister, Fuma wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a>. But Kakyo takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Kotori doesnât want her brother to kill Kamui. Arashi, Sorata, Yuzuriha, Inuki, Subaru, Seiichiro and Daisuke arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the sacred sword. Kamui doesnât support the situation. </p><p>Hien, Sohi and Daisuke are worried about their mistressâs health; but Daisuke is also happy that she hadnât have visions about the âjour de la promesseâ since a long time. Indeed the dark Hinoto gains more and more power weakening the true Hinoto. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Dearest Wish</p><p>==============</p> <p>After the destruction of the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a>, Kamui arrives at the Diet Building. Hinoto tells him the person he saved is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43375\" href=\"/tomoharu-tojyo/4005-43375/\" slug=\"tomoharu-tojyo\">Tomoharu Tojyo</a>, the president of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43390\" href=\"/tojyo-pharmaceutical/4020-43390/\" slug=\"tojyo-pharmaceutical\">Tojyo Pharmaceutical</a>. She orders Daisuke to bring Kamui at Tomoharuâs bedside. Kamui has an ultimate interrogation: how to create a kekkai. She responds only a dragon of Heaven knows the answer. Daisuke tells Kamui that Seiichiro explained he creates a kekkai thinking of a precious thing. Kamui apologizes about his previous behaviour. Daisuke accepts it.</p><p>Kamui and Daisuke arrive at Tojyo Laboratories at Shinjuku where Tomoharu is. He thanks Kamui to save him. Kamui asks why Fuma was there. Tomoharu explains that Sunshine 60 is a kekkai. He explains also that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a> is a clone of his grand-daughter and his son. </p><p>Kamui sees Yuzuriha creating a kekkai and decides to join her. During this time, Daisuke decides to leave Tomoharu Tojyo. He falls on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a>. Fuma sees the dearest wish of Daisuke and decides to realize it. Fuma attacked Daisuke. Hinoto tried to protect him. Fuma decided to eliminate both. Daisuke sacrificed himself in order to protect his mistress.<br/></p><p>His corpse isnât found because Shinjuku is on ruin. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Daisuke could jump the high of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Kazetsukai</p><p>Daisuke can control the wind.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Tokyo Babylon</p><p>================</p>Tokyo Babylon is a manga in which Subaru is the leading protagonist. The story focuses on Subaruâs development and his true abilities, as opposed to his later secondary role in the manga X/1999, as well as his even less important role in Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles. In this story, it chronicles his original life as an exorcist.The story really kicks up when, by a strange twist of fate, Subaru meet a kindly veterinarian name Seichiro Sakurazuka while chasing down different demons and apparitions to exorcize. The meeting is a work of fate, and it turns out that this veterinarian is actually someone who knows about the magical world around us. That entire year, the Subaru and Seichiro begin to grow impressively close, and Seichiro continually confesses his love to him. Subaruâs sister also loved the pairing, and tries to bring the two boys together. This relationship, Subaru keeping up with his work as an exorcist, and the mysteries the demons pose to him get him into a lot of trouble. Also, there seems to be a bit more to Seichiro then what meets the eye.<p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Blossom and the Star</p><p>========================</p><p><u>Spoiler Warning</u>  The information in this may ruin the biggest plot twist in the Tokyo Babylon Series, so if you have not read the series, then I suggest skipping this chapter and not ruin the twist in one of the greatest manga. </p><p>Subaru was born along with his fraternal twin sister, Hokuto, were born on February 19, 1974, into the Sumeragi clan, a clan devoted to exorcism. As he was growing up, he and his twin sister became amazingly close, but he was always pulled away from his sister so that he could study the arts of the exorcist, and would one day be capable of taking on the mantle of the thirteenth head of the Sumeragi clan. He was nine when he went out to train.</p><p>One day, Subaru was finally seen as ready to take become the head of his clan, and was finally able to achieve his ultimate goal. On that day, though, his life would be changed forever. His grandmother left the area, as she had some business near by, and Subaru prepared to wait for her, but then, he seemed to hear a voice calling to him in the wind, and he left the place he was waiting and began moving in the direction of the voice he heard calling to him. As he walked, he discovered a strange cherry tree in bloom, despite the fat that it was far past the time it should be blooming. As he looked at the tree, he sensed a deep sense of hatred and despair emanating from the tree, and he moved, attempting to exorcize the hatred from the blossoms, but they appeared to be protected from some other spell. As he continued to try and exorcize the tree, he felt warm liquid hit his face, and he looked down to see his shirt stained with drops of red. He looked up, and he discovered that above him sat a man, the dead body of a nine year old girl impaled by his arm. The man then pulled his arm out of the girl and looked down at the young exorcist below him.<br/></p><p>The man who sat in the tree smiled and quickly leapt from the tree, landing in front of Subaru, and pushed him down. As he stared at the boy, he brought his hand away from his head. Subaru then quickly opened his eyes, and he realized that he must have fainted in front of the man before him. The said man saw him looking at the tree blossoms, and he asked Subaru if he thought that the cherry blossoms were beautiful, and Subaru told him that he did in fact think that they were beautiful. The man the asked him if he knew that there was a corpse underneath every cherry tree, and the blood from the body seeped into the tree and stained its roots pink. Subaru, hearing this story, asked the strange man if the body was in any pain, and the man before him grew silent in shock at the question. The man then smiled again, and he leaned over to the young Subaru and whispering into his ear:</p>âIf you and I should ever meet again, let us live together for one year. My heart is the direct inverse of yours... you are kind, pure, and honest. And I'm sure that is how you will continue to grow up. Your heart will remain pure. So, if we should ever meet again, I will try my hardest to learn to love you. Just for one year... and after that year, if I can consider you \"special\", you will have won and I will not kill you. But if I decide that I cannot consider you special to me -- if I cannot distinguish the difference between you and that corpse, then... I will kill you. And so today... I will let you go.â<p>He then took Subaruâs hand and kissed them both, and on his hands appeared the shape of an inverted pentagram, marking the young head of the Sumeragi clan. The man then erased Subaruâs memories of the event, and he and the boy then went their separate ways.</p><p>When Subaru returned home, his grandmother saw his newly marked hands, and, in a state of fear, gave him gloves, telling him that he should never take them off, and enchanting them, so that they could never be removed. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Seichiro Sakurazuka</p><p>===================</p><p>Six years after Subaruâs strange meeting with the man in the cherry tree, Subaru had taken up a job as a spirit detective in Tokyo. One day, he was chasing a Shiki (a summoned spirit) when he followed the Shiki into train station. He continued to keep his eyes on the Shiki, which had taken the form of a hawk, but, as he ran, he failed to observe the ground, and tripped, hitting his face on the ground. As he lay on the ground, a man came over and helped him up. The man was a veterinarian named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a>. </p><p>The veterinarian and Subaru became great friends, and Seichiro proved that he actually knew much about the paranormal world, as he was the head of the Sakurazuka clan, who were skilled in the same abilities as Subaru. Eventually, Seichiro began to openly confess his love to Subaru, who found every single mention of this as extremely embarrassing.</p><p>One day, Subaru had a dream of the day he had met the man underneath the cherry tree. Again he stood as a nine year old child underneath the cherry tree which was blooming even when it was out of season, and again he was talking to the strange man before him. The man told him the story of the corpse and the tree, and then, he moved to Subaru and knelt beside him, and he began whispering in his ear:</p>âIf you and I should ever meet againâ¦â<p>The wind then kicked up, and the rest of the manâs speech was obscured by the swirling sound of the air around him. The wind then began to die down, and Subaru heard the man tell him that he would let him go on that day. Subaru then awoke, questioning what he had just seen. </p><p>Later that day, Seichiro and Subaru discussed how they met with Subaruâs sister, and she began laughing at the fact that Seichiro had come into contact with Subaru because he fell flat on his face. She then turned to Seichiro and told him that she couldnât believe that he had fallen in love with such a klutzy man, especially after that first impression. Seichiro then smiles at this and tells her that this is not the first time that both Subaru and him had met, and Subaru is shocked, remembering the man in the cherry tree, and he begins to believe that the two people appear to be very similar in appearance, although they seem to be the exact opposite personality wise.</p><p>Seichiro then stood up and began moving towards Subaru and then, as he moved closer to him, he smiled and told him he was only kidding, and that it had become all the rage to say that two lovers had met in a past life. As Hokuto and Seichiro discussed this ideal, Subaruâs mind then began to wander back to the memory of the man, and he asked out loud who the man was, causing Hokuto to accuse him of cheating on Seichiro (even though they werenât going out.) Seichiro just put his hand onto Hokutoâs shoulder, telling her that it was fine, since he was obviously undesirable.</p><p>Seichiro then followed up this statement by saying that he, being only a lonely veterinarian, would never be able to live up to the amazing work which Subaru did. This caused Subaru to comfort his friend, telling him that being a veterinarian was a very honorable job, and Seichiro smiled, telling Subaru that, since they were over that, they could then begin planning their wedding. </p><p>Subaru then told Seichiro that he was a guy, and that they should truly stop joking around about such things. Seichiro then turned towards Subaru and told him that he loved him, and when Subaru told him that those were the jokes he was talking about, Seichiro told him to look at his face and see if he was joking. He wasnât.</p><p>He then moved closer to Subaru, pinning him against the wall, and telling Subaru that he had just fallen in love, and that the person he had fallen in love with just happened to be a man, but he then moved away, smiling and saying that Subaru must only see him as a pervert. Hokuto then proceeded to give the two men her blessing, much to the chagrin of Subaru, and then Seichiro told them that he was closing for the day, and that they should go for a picnic. </p><p>The three of them made their way to the park, and they began to pass dozens of half bloomed cherry trees. Again ,Subaru began thinking of the man in the tree, and as he walked, he saw to his right a fully blossomed cherry tree, and he stopped, looking carefully at it. Seichiro, seeing Subaru stop, moved after him, and he asked him if anything was wrong. Subaru then turned to the tree and mentioned how it appeared to be the only one in bloom. Subaru then smiled, and his hand slowly moved up to his glasses. He grabbed a hold of them, and, taking them off, he told Subaru that he knew the reason why, asking him if he knew about the corpse underneath the tree, stunning Subaru. </p><p>Seichiro then returned his glasses to his face, and moved off to where they were picnicking. Subaru, sending one final glance towards the blossoming cherry tree, followed him, wondering if he was the man he had met underneath the tree seven years prior.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Conversation at the Vets</p><p>========================</p><p>In 1991, Subaru had become a happy and caring young man, and is first shown exorcizing the spirit of a woman named Akie for a man. As the man cowered at his back, he began chanting his spells, and the horrid face of the ghost before him began to disappear, leaving the face of a beautiful woman, who thanked the young head of the Sumeragi clan before fading away. Subaru then turned to the man cowering behind him and told him that the spirit was now gone and could rest in peace. </p><p>Later that day, Subaru and a small puppy are at the veterinarianâs office with Hokuto and he tells her the story of how the man was being haunted by a girl he had seduced to his home one night. At the end on the night, he told her that he was not going to follow up on their relationship, causing the girl to fall into a state of depression before killing herself. This story caused Hokuto to burst into a fit of hysterical laughter at the story, calling it just a silly way for someone to stay after death, even going so far as to say that not even a womanâs magazine would accept the story. </p><p>Hokuto then asked Subaru why the ghost had only appeared in the manâs bed, and the response that it was the only thing that she remember of the room, she again burst into a fit of laughter, commenting that he must have taken her home and only shown her the ceiling. Her bliss suddenly disappeared, and she told Subaru that the man he had just helped was an awful man for treating any woman in such a vile and despicable way. She then began to comment on how woman should be the only one allowed to cheat on a man, bringing her hand down onto the table, causing a worried Subaru to tell her to not destroy the waiting room of the veterinarianâs office, as they would have to pay for any damages inflicted on the place. </p><p>Hokuto then began on a long rant about how the man, who was using the money that the honest working people earned with their sweat and blood, was at the lowest of the low and was only useful to clean up. She then angrily turned to Subaru and told him that he shouldnât have helped someone so amoral. Subaru then began to say something, but she cut him off, saying that he didnât seem to understand because he was a man. Subaru assured her that he was a man, and then was about to explain his reasons when a man at the door to the vetâs told her that he had done the exorcism not for the man, but for the girl who was forced to suffer because of the manâs sins. </p><p>Both the siblings turned to the voice, and greeted its owner, Seichiro Sakurazuka, who then offers both of them drinks. Hokuto accuses Seishiro of just having male sympathy, just as she had accused Subaru of having, but Seichiro only smiled, telling her that he would normally take the side of a girl.  He then told her that she knew quite well just how much pain and sorrow a spirit trapped on earth feels. </p><p>Subaru then turned away from the two and began playing with the puppy in his arms as Seichiro said from behind him that Subaru had only done it for the woman, and not for the man who had taken advantage of her while she was living. She then retorted that Seichiro always understood exactly what Subaru wanted, to which Seichiroâs only reply was that he made sure to purify himself each day. Then, looking at the two men sitting in front of her, she smiled, bringing both of her hands together to form a heart with her hand as she said how good of a couple they make, much to the embarrassment of Subaru. When he protested, though, she only commented that Seichiro had already fallen in love with Subaru at first sight. </p><p>Smiling to herself, she went on to explain how Subaru is the heir to the Sumeragi clan, who practice the exact same magic as that of the Sakurazuka family, of which Seichiro is the heir. Then, she said how romantic the two of them were, and how it seemed almost like a fairy tale, before commenting how neither of the people involved in the relationship are forceful enough to get together. Seichiro then got up, to get a warmer pot of tea. </p><p>Seichiro came back with a bowl full of food, which Subaru then took and began feeding to the small canine in his hands. Hokuto again spoke up, pointing at him and saying that he is the hero of this story, and then, pointing to Seichiro, asking him if he thought it was ok for a man who was the heir to a family of assassins to be eating so happily. He then smiled, saying that he could never take on the family business, as he is to in love with life. She then turned back to Subaru and began accusing him of not being right if he was one meant to save the world. He simply smiled at this, saying that he was only a simple master of exorcism. He then looked at the clock, and realized that he had to go to one more case. He grabbed his hat and prepared to leave the building, and, Seichiro, seeing how late it was, offered to take him to wherever he was going for the job. Hokuto jumped onto this idea, and, seeing her enthusiasm, he offered to bring her too, saying it would be fun, like a picnic, only for Subaru to remind him that he wasnât going for fun. </p><p>Seichiro then walked up to Hokuto and told her that they needed some time to bond, since she would one day become his sister-in-law, again embarrassing Subaru, who turned and yelled at the comment. Seichiro just ignored him, though, and ran to get his keys. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Problematic Apparel</p><p>=======================</p><p>Subaru entered the house and was greeted by an elderly woman who told him that the man of the house was not home. He asked her where the girl that they had talked about was, and she began leading him up to a bedroom. It was a mess, and the woman behind him told him that a girl that worked for the man of the house had uncharacteristically trashed the room, and she had called to make sure that Subaru because her husband had used Subaru before. She then turned to Subaru and asked him how old he was. Before he could answer, though, he saw on in the other end of the room a girl, who began laughing madly. </p><p>Objects began to fly towards Subaru, and he began to dodge to the best of his ability, noting how strange it was that there was no spiritual energy coming from the girl.  He quickly drew a pentagram in the air before him, which would normally dispel a ghost, but the girl just continued to attack him, and he realized that what he was fighting was not dead. She again attempted to attack him, but he did a quick flip over her, and landing behind her, he began wondering why a living spirit would be there. Then, as he pondered, the girl thrust her hand at his head, and he quickly summoned a spell which created a shield around him. The attack broke through his shield though, and again, he dodged, ducking underneath the oncoming attack as he began another incantation. </p><p>As he chanted his new incantation, Subaru pulled out a slip of paper and through it at his opponent. It landed right on her left breast, and Subaru finished his incantation as her jacket suddenly burst open. Her clothes began to emit a steam, and different spirits began making their way out of her apparel. The spirit disappeared, and Subaru realized that the living spirits were within the girlâs clothes. She attacked him again, and he leaned backwards, avoiding her hand, before he jumped into the air. He began falling behind her, and he chopped her directly in the neck. She fell to the ground, but her clothes continued to try and attack him, but her body weight kept them from moving. </p><p>As Subaru realized just how much hatred was trapped within her clothes, he realized that he had to remove them, but unfortunately, due to the fact that he is a guy, he realizes just how wrong that would be for him to do. He forced himself to remove her clothes, though, and was able to get another set of clothing onto her before she woke up. </p><p>When the girl awoke, she told Subaru that she had bought the clothes at a store that was near a grand battle arena, and that the spirit had absorbed all the hatred of both the losing contestants as well as those of shoppers. When Subaru told this to his sister later, Seichiro, who had overheard him, commented on how the hatred of humanity was becoming so great that it was beginning to even overpower the supernatural. Hokuto agreed with the statement, smiling of how she told that a nuclear bomb in Europe was no where near as deadly as a few women shopping. She then smiled even wider as she told how women with their aerosol hair spray and buying their comic books as it destroys the trees, and taking showers in the morning despite there being a water crisis.</p><p>After hearing her speech, Subaru questioned her, telling her that she did all of those things, and that if she wanted to save the world, then maybe she should stop doing such things. Hokuto only laughed at this, though, telling Subaru that they would be used in any case, and that she should at least make it destroy the planet while making her beautiful, Only for Subaru to Comment on how Dangerous this style of thinking was. Seichiro then spoke up, and told them that he just loved Tokyo, and when Subaru asked him his reasons on this, he told him happily:</p>âBecause it is the only city on earth that can enjoy itself as it walks the path to destruction!â<p>He then stated in a carefree matter that he and Subaruâs wedding should be soon, as to avoid the end of the world, much to Subaruâs embarrassment. He quickly got over his embarrassment, and told the two people in front of him that he to loved the city that was Tokyo, but that his reasons were different then those of Seichiro, but he never elaborated.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Tokyo Tower Tremors</p><p>=======================</p><p>Subaru was called away to another case shortly after his incident with the woman and her clothes, and he was told that the Tokyo Tower had been experiencing multiple tremors. Although this was not very uncommon, due to the towerâs huge size causing it to pick up even the smallest shifts in the tectonic plates, the entire tower had recently been shaking, causing a state of panic for the workers. </p><p>As Subaru sat across from the two people who were telling him this information, he began to ponder what may be causing these tremors. As he sat pondering, though, he was asked for an autograph by one of the men across from him who was interested in Subaruâs line of work. </p><p>After signing the autograph, Subaru was shown into the towerâs observation room, and, as he entered into the room, it began to shake. The shaking quickly subsided though, and, as he stood up, he saw both Hokuto and Seichiro hurrying towards him, and he quickly asked them what they were doing there. Hokuto told him that they were there for a date, and when Subaru asked who was dating, she told him that it was between him and Seichiro, causing Subaru to angrily yell at her. </p><p>Hokuto turned, and told him that there was no couple that had not gone to Tokyo Tower. Seichiro then offered to treat Hokuto to some parfaits, to which he told her he would buy, as he would never dream of making his future sister-in-law pay for a parfait, again aggravating Subaru. </p><p>Seichiro returned a little while later, offering Subaru an ice cream cone. Subaru accepted it, and Hokuto ran up, asking Seichiro why she didnât get an ice cream cone. He told her that he had offered, but that she had not accepted it. She only took some of his, and Seichiro then offered some of his to Subaru as well, which he hurriedly declined. Seichiro and Hokuto then told him that he needed to loosen up. Subaru became embarrassed, telling her that would just make him a pervert, but she told him that that was the way which lovers acted, causing another embarrassed outburst from Subaru. </p><p>Hokuto then turned to Seichiro and told him that h needed to be working harder to get Subaru to love him, and Seichiro simply told her that he was trying, but that it appeared he was not attractive enough, causing Subaru to tell him that that wasnât true, and that he was attractive. Seichiro then turned and smiled at him, and then asking quite innocently if Subaru thought he was sexy, causing much more agitation on the part of Subaru.</p><p>Shortly after this, the building began to shake, and Subaru, looking down, saw the spirit of a girl crying out that she hated Tokyo, before he fell backwards, being caught by none other then Seichiro. When Subaru realized that he was in Seichiroâs arms, he freaked, finding that their faces were just a bit to close. He then quickly pulled away and, reaching down, picked up the hat which had fallen off his head when he fell.</p><p>As he stood up again, Seichiro asked him if he was going to do the exorcism that night, and Subaru told him that he would. Seichiro then smiled, and asked Subaru if he could tag along. He then told Subaru that he thought it would be romantic being on Tokyo Tower at night, with the moon shining above them. </p><p>That night, Seichiro and Subaru sat by the window of the first observation Deck of Tokyo Tower, and Seichiro began telling Subaru about how Tokyo Tower had become a symbol of Tokyo, and how, as time went on, It had changed very much, such as little pink dolls in the window being replaced by figurines of Michael Jackson and Madonna. He then turned to Subaru with his trademark innocent smile and told him:</p>âThe passage of time is cruel, is it not?â<p>Subaru turned to respond, but before he could do so, he heard a noise in front of them, and he turned as Seichiro casually said that the ghost had arrived. Subaru pulled out four of his magic parchments and threw them against the wall, using his magic to create a barrier between him and the ghost. He began to make seals with his hand and he asked Seichiro to not walk passed the border. Seichiro cheerfully agreed to stay in the area of the barrier, and Subaru began walking forward, chanting incantations as he went. </p><p> The spirit then appeared before him, and, with a swipe of her hand, the pillar in which his barrier was set exploded, shattering the only defense between the spirit and Seichiro. The Spirit then sent a blast of energy towards Subaru, and, just before it hit him, he felt himself being lifted off of the ground, and he discovered Seichiro carrying him out of dangerâs way. The spirit then turned her attention to the veterinarian, and quickly, he pulled a lighter from his coat pocket, and with some swift incantations, a huge ball of fire engulfed her. Seeing the power, Subaru realized that he had forgotten that Seichiro was also a sorcerer. </p><p>Subaru then got out of Seichiroâs arms and made another incantation, sending the girl into a scream of pain. Then, stopping his incantations, he told her that he had not come to exorcize her, but he had only come to talk, only for her to shout tat she hated Japan and all of the Japanese. </p><p>Subaru then turned to her and asked her to at least tell them who she was and why she hated Japan and the Japanese.  He then saw a look of shock cross her face, and he smiled, introducing himself to her. She then asked him who Seichiro was, to which he responded that he was only a humble veterinarian. She then told him that no ordinary veterinarian that she knew could shoot blasts of fire at her. He again smiled and told her that he was only defending the man who he loved, and she smiled, commenting on how great it was to be in love. </p><p>She sat down next to the two magic users, and told them that her name was Kato Kazue, and that she had moved to Tokyo in the hopes of becoming an actor. She was unsuccessful though, and she was forced to work hard and live in a small run down apartment. She then told them that she had appeared on television a few times, but simply as a cameo, such as a person on the street or in a cafÃ©. Despite the insignificance of these roles, Subaru still told her that that was an impressive feat, and she told him that he was a very nice boy. </p><p>She then told them how one day, she had finally gotten what she had always wanted, a speaking role in a movie. In a fit of excitement, she called everyone that she knew and told them the good news, and her mother was even brought to tears by the good news. She made sure that she got the part, even going so far as to sleep with the producer, but she was finally assured the part. She showed up on the first day, but, when she arrived, the lead actress stormed off of the set after an argument with the producer. She refused to act, and the movie was cancelled. Distraught over the loss of the part, she went to Tokyo Tower and jumped off, perishing in the streets below. </p><p>After remembering the ways of her death, she began to cry, and grew angry, shouting out that she had not deserved such a tragedy, but Seichiro then told her that she was just like the actress who had ruined the movie. She turned on him, infuriated, but he smiled and told her that her death had caused for someone to clean up the remains, someone to arrange the burial, someone to live through the trauma of seeing a suicide, and he told her that she had caused just as much damage by her suicide. She then screamed that she hated Tokyo, but Seichiro asked her if she truly felt that way, for she wouldnât still be in the tower if she had not loved it. Finally, she smiled, and told them how much she loved Tokyo Tower, and Subaru finally exorcized her, letting her rest in peace.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Betrayal</p><p>========</p> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a> practices his activity of dark onmyoji opposing to the sumeragi family.

And to make a kekkai disappear, one of the ways is to kill the kekkaiâs creator. So Nataku attacks Subaru, but Subaru is too strong. Understanding that, Fuma decides to finish the battle. He fixes Kamui in the building. Then he attacks Subaru. The Onmyoji dodges every attack. Moreover, he succeeds to shut Fuma up. But for Subaru, Fuma looks like Seichiro which perturb him. Fuma takes advantage of the situation. He breaks the barrier launched by Subaru and hurts him severely. Kamui doesnât support this scene, liberates himself and attacks Fuma.

Kamui brings Subaru at the hospital where he will be operated. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Hospitalization</p><p>===============</p> <p>Arashi and Sorata visit Sorata at the hospital.

Sorata promises to Subaru to protect Kamui. </p><p>Yuzuhira stays at Subaruâs bedside. She begs his pardon to be not there when he fought Fuma. Subaru responds it was his fault because heâs selfish and he doesnât care of others. Yuzuhira doesnât believe that, she thinks heâs a good person. She made him the promise to call her when he will need help. He accepts.

The two Onmyoji begin their fight. Subaru launches a kekkai.</p><p>Subaru and Seichiro give all they have in this fight; at this point that a major part of the bridge is destroyed. Seichiro asks if Subaruâs wish is to kill him. Subaru denies it. Each opponent sends their ultimate attack. Kamui and Arashi arrive and see that Subaruâs kekkai dissolves. Arashi and Kamui are looking for Subaru. They find the Sakurazukamori with his heart pierced by Subaruâs hand. Subaru doesnât understand how it could be. Seichiro explains that when he killed his sister, Hokuto launched a spell on Seichiro. If he tries to kill Subaru as he killed Hokuto, then the spell will invert the hit. Subaru wished to be killed by the person he loves, even if Seichiro doesnât love him in return. Seichiro says he knows the spells and he did it because it was the only way to be killed by Subaru. Seichiro murmurs his last words at Subaruâs ear (Surely that he loves him). Because Subaruâs kekkai was dissolved, the damage caused on the bridge is real. Kamui has just the time to save Subaru before the total destruction of the Rainbow Bridge. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Succession</p><p>==========</p><p>Kamui visits Subaru and asks if everything is ok.

But he proposes to realize Seichiroâs one. Fuma tells Subaru that the Sakurazukamori was displeased to see Subaru wounded by another person than him. So he wished to erase this wound. Fuma offers to Subaru Seichiroâs left eye. Fuma understands Seichiroâs wish because he will do the same for Kamui. Fuma advises also Subaru that if he accepts Seichiroâs gift, he will become the new Sakurazukamori.</p><p>Fuma joins Subaru, the new Sakurazukamori. He is amused to see that Subaru doesnât assimilate Fuma to Seichiro anymore. For Subaru, Seichiro doesnât exist anymore. Fuma tells him Seichiro still live in his right eye. That is implied that Subaru must live if he wants that a part of Seichiro still live. Subaru asks Fuma his dearest wish. Fuma responds only Kamui could realize his wish.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Jour de la Promesse</p><p>===================</p><p>Others kekkai are destroyed. Kamui receives the call of the sacred sword. He goes to unseal it. Kakyo tells him if he unseals the sacred sword, tragedies will come. Kamui doesnât listen to him and unseals it.

Fuma feels it and decides to fight the dragons of Heaven. Subaru stays with Fuma.</p><p>Fuma launches the battle with their angels. The fight is rough. Kamui doesnât understand Fuma. Fuma responds he doesnât even know his dearest wish. Fuma continues his attack and takes the advantage. Kamui doesnât want to believe he has another wish that bring back Fuma. Subaru confirms what Fuma said. He begs Kamui to find his dearest wish. Kamui remembers what Karen said at Natakuâs grave. Kamui understands what Fuma wants, but Fuma is ready to kill him. <br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>====================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Like every dragon, Subaru could jump the high of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Shikigami</p><p>Subaru can materialize his soul as an animal.

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Kanoe is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>âs younger sister. She was very close of her sister until the day Hinoto decided to become a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a>. She lost four of her five senses to receive in return the gift to see future in dreams. She kept only her sight. Her sister Kanoe was upset to see her sacrifice and decided to leave her. She took also a weaker third eye in order to counter her sister. Kanoe can only enter in otherâs dream. </p><p>When Kanoe spied Hinotoâs dream and learnt about the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â and her decision to gather the [[seven seals:char43407]] together, Kanoe decided to gather the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a> together. She found the first angel in her job place: the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43396\" href=\"/city-hall-of-tokyo/4020-43396/\" slug=\"city-hall-of-tokyo\">City Hall of Tokyo</a>. It was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a> who became quickly her lover. When she learnt that a genius of computer science worked for freemasonry, Kanoe sent her an invitation to join her. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43366\" href=\"/satsuki-yatoji/4005-43366/\" slug=\"satsuki-yatoji\">Satsuki Yatoji</a> accepted. She permitted Satsuki to create <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>. She accepted to join them because she wanted fun. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Beginning</p><p>===========</p> <p>Hinoto learns that the âjour de la promesseâ will come soon when she spies a conversation between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> and Hinoto and also after a call from Yuto who apologizes to be late and explains he fought one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. He tells also the fight finished by a draw due to the penetration into a perfect <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> by a student. Kanoe understands one of her sisterâs visions about the end of the world. Happy, she goes to talk to Satsuki Yatoji. She confirms that is the real Kamui. Kanoe must let Satsuki because she has her job of secretary to do above there. Indeed they are under the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43396\" href=\"/city-hall-of-tokyo/4020-43396/\" slug=\"city-hall-of-tokyo\">City Hall of Tokyo</a>.</p><p>Kanoe continues to spy her sister and discovers that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> has been stolen. Kanoe wakes up. Yuto is here and asks her if there is a problem. Kanoe reveals him that the sacred sword has been stolen. Yuto thinks it was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> the responsible. Satsuki arrives and contradict him. Indeed she discovered that Sorata is a monk from Koya mount, so he is one of the seven seals. Kanoe asks Satsuki to find the sacred sword. With the help of Beast and her natural capacity to communicate with computers, she finds that the robber is a young man with a mark composed of petals on his forehead. This last information astonishes greatly Kanoe. She knows that symbol belongs to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43390\" href=\"/tojyo-pharmaceutical/4020-43390/\" slug=\"tojyo-pharmaceutical\">Tojyo Pharmaceutical</a>.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Persuasion</p><p>============</p> <p>Kanoe still wants to stop her sister, she fells she could use <a data-ref-id=\"4040-43258\" href=\"/frank-chiaramonte/4040-43258/\" slug=\"frank-chiaramonte\">Frank Chiaramonte</a>âs brother when she sees Hinotoâs vision about Kotoriâs death. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> dreams and meets Kanoe inside. She requires him to help the Earth. She shows him his happy childhood, the death of his mother with a Kamui leeching <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43364\" href=\"/saya-mono/4005-43364/\" slug=\"saya-mono\">Saya Mono</a>âs head, his fatherâs death and finally Kamui killing Kotori. Kanoe explains that the death of his sister is a possible future if he doesnât kill Kamui. </p><p>Seeing she didnât succeed with Fuma, she decides to convince Kamui to join her. She intervenes in a conversation between Hinoto and Kamui. Whereas Hinoto reveals that Kamui means âthe one who takes the place of godsâ authorityâ, Kanoe explains that Kamui could means also âthe one who chase godsâ authorityâ. She reveals also that Kamui has the choice to become a dragon of Heaven or a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. Kamui has two destinies. Kanoe tries to show him the other future; but Hinoto uses her powers to chase her from her vision. When Satsuki and Yuto see Kanoeâs state, they are worried about her. She reassures them telling them that she teased her sister a little too much. She reveals also that the man who countered Beast may be a dragon of Earth. She requires Satsuki to find information about him.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Doubt and Certitude</p><p>==================</p> <p>An earthquake destroys a new kekkai. Every dragons and allies feel it. Hinoto and Kanoe discuss in Hinotoâs dream. Kanoe says that is the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a> who destroyed the Nakano Sunplaza. She explains there are two Kamui. At this moment, the vision of Kakyo comes through Hinotoâs dream. They think it is due to a yumemi, a dragon. Kanoe shows Hinoto Kotoriâs vision she had where she dies for the Earth. Kanoe and Hinoto continue their conversation. Kanoe confirms that if Kamui has two destinies, there is only one future: the death of Kotori. When Hinoto has a vision where a Kamui with angel wings kills a Kamui with devil wings, Kanoe understands there are two Kamui. </p><p>Indeed her thought comes true when Kamui decides to become a seal. Fuma becomes automatically the Kamui of the seven angels. Fuma kills emotionless his own sister. Hinoto is afflicted whereas Kanoe is surprised by the cold heart of Fuma. Kanoe has another conversation with her sister. She scoffs at Hinoto saying that the second Kamui is awake and there is only one future. Beast detects the arrival of Fuma and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a>. Beast confirms it is Kamui. Kanoe welcomes Fuma as Kamui.</p><p>The last angels join them with the sacred sword.</p><p>Kanoe, Yuto and Satsuki are wondering about Fuma. Indeed he has a cold heart, but he takes care of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a>. Kanoe is completely disoriented by Fumaâs behaviour. She has a bad feeling about him. Nevertheless she is also worried about the angelsâ behaviours. She thinks they are selfish and lazy.</p><p> <a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Love</p><p>=======</p><p>Time elapsed and several kekkai are already destroyed. Kanoe tries to enter into her sisterâs dream; but she cannot do anymore. She is confused; because the only thing she wants is to prove Hinoto is wrong. Then she could lose her duty to be a yumemi. But Kanoe thinks it is not a problem because one of the seven angels is a yumemi too. The fact Kanoe cannot see her sisterâs dream is because the dark side of Hinoto took her place. Dark Hinoto is happy to see her yumemi coming true. The real Hinoto tries to stop her; but dark Hinoto is too strong. The real Hinoto calls her sister for help. Kanoe hears it, but thinks it is an illusion. For her, it is her wish to help her sister to stop to be a yumemi which creates this illusion. Yuto asks Kanoe if her worries about Hinoto are because she loves her sister. Kanoe confirms. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Death</p><p>========</p><p>Hinoto tries once again to call help from her sister. This time, Kanoe hears it and goes to Hinotoâs dream. But the dark Hinoto feels it and goes inside this dream. She reveals she is existed to Kanoe. So she must eliminate her. She uses her powers to kill Kanoe.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>Third Eye</p><p>With her third eye, Kanoe can only enter in peopleâs dreams.</p><br/>",

Hinoto predicted her that she would die twice for the Earth. Kazuki had a congenital disease and was condemned to die. Her father and grandfather tried to find a remedy to heal her. But they didnât succeed and Kazuki died. Masaki promised her that he would bring her back.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Rebirth</p><p>==========</p><p>Years past; Masaki and Tomoharu succeeded to clone partially Kazuki. In order to achieve the cloning and remembering his promise, Masaki sacrificed himself. The cloning was completed. Tomoharu didnât see in the clone his grand-daughter. Indeed the clone had no sex; he is a combination between a man and a woman. Tomoharu considered that the clone had no soul. He decided to nickname him Nataku. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Sacred Sword</p><p>===============</p> <p>Tomoharu learnt from Hinoto that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> is the key of the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â.

When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> comes back to Tokyo, Tomoharu can detect the sacred sword at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a>. He asks Nataku to steal it. </p><p>A storm begins above the Togakushi Shrine. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43359\" href=\"/kyogo-mono/4005-43359/\" slug=\"kyogo-mono\">Kyogo Mono</a> is here and remembers how the sacred sword is responsible of the death of his wife. Kyogo feels the introduction of an intruder inside his Shrine. A fight begins between the young intruder and Kyogo. Even if Kyogo fights with the sacred sword, the ribbon of the intruder is superior. Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> receive the call of the sword and go to the Shrine. But it was too late, the intruder kills Kyogo. He steals the sword, introduces himself as Nataku, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a> and runs away. Nataku is surprised to see that Fuma looks like Masaki.</p><p>At <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43390\" href=\"/tojyo-pharmaceutical/4020-43390/\" slug=\"tojyo-pharmaceutical\">Tojyo Pharmaceutical</a> inside the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a>, Nataku is stabilized in a serum whereas Tomoharu Tojyo explains Nataku is a genetic creation, an artificial human being created for the âjour de la promesseâ. He interrogates his employees to know which information they find on the sacred sword. The only information they have is that the sacred sword is alive.</p><p>Another sacred sword does its appearance. Nataku feels the call of the swords. This calls become more and more important. One day, Nataku decides to help the sacred sword he stole. He breaks free and takes the sword to bring it to Fuma. He joins Fuma and the other angels. He gives the sacred sword to Fuma. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Family</p><p>=========</p> <p>Days past; all the data about Nataku is downloaded by <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>. Fuma observes <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a>âs visions when Nataku enters and explains the situation. Fuma explains that the seven angels are free to do whatever they want. Now he can survive without the help of Tojyo Pharmaceutical. Nataku replies he wants to stay with Fuma because he reminds him his father. </p><p>Nataku decides to help Fuma to destroy <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>. He goes to the Sunshine 60 and attacks it. For his grand-father, it confirms that Nataku has no soul. Fuma joins them and asks Nataku to achieve Tomoharu Tojyo. Nataku is ready to do it when Fuma stops him when he feels the presence of Kamui. On the roof, Kamui finds Fuma. Fuma tells him he must create a kekkai if he wants to protect people. He goes to attack him, but Fuma shows him Tomoharu Tojyo. Fuma attacks Kamui knowing he will protect the old man. Fuma is ready to finish him when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> arrives and creates a kekkai. To destroy the building, the kekkai must disappear. And to make a kekkai disappear, one of the ways is to kill the kekkaiâs creator. So Nataku attacks Subaru, but Subaru is too strong. Understanding that, Fuma decides to finish the battle and asks Nataku to leave. Nataku accepts and goes away. Fuma destroys the kekkai.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Kekkai</p><p>==========</p><p>Nataku decides to continue to destroy kekkai. He decides to attack the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43401\" href=\"/yamanote-line/4020-43401/\" slug=\"yamanote-line\">Yamanote Line</a>. Karen learns that and decides to go. Karen arrives at Yamanote line, creates a kekkai and attacks Nataku. With her pyrokinetic powers, Karen beats easily Nataku. She asks him why he did that. He explains he has no feelings. She replies everyone has feelings. That is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a> attacks with his hydrokinetic powers. Like before, Yuto jokes with his opponent. The fight is intense and no one take the advantage. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a> does his entrance in order to help Karen. He is wounded. Yuto proposes to cancel their fight in order to take care of their injured partner. Karen accepts the draw and disrupts her kekkai. Yuto brings Nataku back to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43396\" href=\"/city-hall-of-tokyo/4020-43396/\" slug=\"city-hall-of-tokyo\">City Hall of Tokyo</a>.</p><p>Nataku decides to continue his job. Karen tries to stop Nataku; but he succeeds to destroy a new kekkai. Even if he is an angel, Karen sees in him an innocent child.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Dearest Wish</p><p>==============</p><p>Fuma learns that two seals go to Ginza. Fuma requires Nataku to go in order to destroy Ginza.</p><p>Karen and Seiichiro arrive at Ginza. A feeling of danger surrounds the place. Karen creates a kekkai and asks Seiichiro to do the same. She wants to be sure that place wonât be destroyed. It is at this moment that Nataku attacks Ginza. When he sees that is Karen is opponent, Nataku is sad. But his duty is to destroy the kekkai, so he attacks them. They dodge each attack and they are wondering why Nataku launches always the same attack. Nataku begs Karen to leave the place. For Karen, this request is a proof that Nataku has feelings. He explains to her that he is a clone and he always heard he has no soul and no feelings. Karen understands because she lived the same thing with her mother. Seiichiro tries to intervene, but he is stopped by Karen. She asks Nataku if he knows what do the seven angels. He reveals that he had some information by Tomoharu Tojyo. He said a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> told him that his grand-daughter would die twice and would be concern by the âjour de la promesseâ. That was why he asked Nataku to steal the sacred sword in order to be sure he would not die. Karen is happy to learn that there is a person who loves him. She asks him why he joined the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. He explains he wants to be with Fuma. It is another proof that Nataku has feelings because he loves Fuma. </p><p>It is at this moment that Fuma does his entrance. For Karen, he looks like Seiichiro, her dearest person. Fuma sees that Nataku has another wish. That is why he wants to check which one is the more important. He attacks Karen, but Nataku saves her. Fuma requires Nataku to leave, but Karen tells him to follow his heart. He takes his decision. So Fuma launches a massive attack. Seiichiro dodges it, but it is the intervention of Nataku which permits to Karen to not be injured. Fuma stares at them. Karen asks Nataku to let her, but he doesnât want. He knows that Karen has no chance with Fuma. He stays to protect Karen and Fuma kills him. Nataku has just the time to say that the yumemi Tomoharu Tojyo saw was Hinoto. Karen argues Fuma to explain this. Fuma explains that was the dearest wish of Nataku: to die for his dearest person by the person he loves. Nataku assimilates Karen as his mother and Fuma as his father. Fuma decides to leave in order to respect Natakuâs wish. Moreover he lets Natakuâs corpse to Karen because he knows she will take care of him.</p><p>Nataku is buried near Kotori.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Like every dragon, Nataku could jump the high of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Telekinesis</p><p>Nataku can use his telekinesis in order to use his ribbon like a weapon.</p><br/>",

When she grew, her abilities of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a> raised. She became a genius of computer science. The freemasonry required her service. Her parents forced her to accept. She was boring to help them. When she received a message from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43363\" href=\"/kanoe/4005-43363/\" slug=\"kanoe\">Kanoe</a> to join her as a dragon of Earth, she accepted and killed all the freemasonry.

She loves spending time with him. Even if she has <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>, there is nothing to do until the arrival of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>. Satsuki confirms he is Kamui. Kanoe sees in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>âs dream that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a> are his weakness.   <p>She informs it to Satsuki. She is waiting the right moment to play with Kotori.

Yuto thinks it was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> the responsible. Satsuki arrives and contradict him. Indeed she discovered that Sorata is a monk from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43393\" href=\"/koya-mount/4020-43393/\" slug=\"koya-mount\">Koya Mount</a>, so he is one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a>. Kanoe asks Satsuki to find the sacred sword.

This last information astonishes greatly Kanoe.<br/><br/><strong><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Play and Research</span></strong><br/><br/>One day when Kotori goes to her periodical medical alone through the ravaged street where Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> fought, Satsuki decides to kill her. Suddenly, electrical cables attack Kotori. Just in time, she is saved by a strong man. The electrical attack continues but the man stops it with strong attacks. The man tells Kotori to be careful, especially near Kamuiâs house; then he leaves jumping from roof to roof.

Kanoe arrives at this moment explaining that the Kotoriâs savior may be a dragon of Earth. She requires Satsuki to find information about him.</p> <p>She doesnât need to do it because when Fuma wakes up as the Kamui of the Earth, Kusanagi comes by himself.

Yuzuriha is wondering where could be the angel responsible of this earthquake. Through Beast, Satsuki sees Yuzuriha attacking with Inuki electrical cables and decides to have a talk with her. By the intermediary of a giant screen, Satsuki introduces herself as one of the dragons of Earth. Yuzuriha asks her why she accepts to destroy buildings where people are. Satsuki returns the question saying why not killing people. She thinks human being is an animal like others. Because he is superior to others, he can kill everything he wants. But angels are superior to humans. So why cannot she kill people? Yuzuriha doesnât find any answer. Satsuki attacks her, but sacrifice itself in order to protect Yuzuriha. She doesnât support this sacrifice, tears in tears and faints. The kekkai is dissipated. Hopefully, Kusanagi is there to rescue her. Yuto joins Satsuki telling her she asks a difficult question. For Satsuki, there is no good answer. Whereas Yuto thinks the answer is: Because some people will be sad. Beast sees this tender discussion.<br/><br/><strong><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Kekkai</span></strong> <p>Days past; Satsuki observes Fuma destroying Ebisu in order to inform Kanoe. Kanoe is worried about the angelsâ behaviours and has a bad feeling about Fuma. Satsuki decides to destroy another kekkai. She chooses Inogashira. Yuzuriha and Arashi are already there and Arashi launches a kekkai. Beast attacks Yuzuriha and Arashi. They dodge each attack. But Yuzuriha stumbles and Beast continues to attack her. At this moment Inuki transforms itself in a huge shield in order to protect Yuzuriha. Then it transforms itself in a sword which permits to Yuzuriha to attack electrical cables. Satsuki is surprised to see a reincarnated Inuki, but she doesnât care because major party of the Earth will be destroyed. The only thing she cares is the behaviour of Beast. When Satsuki says she will be late for a tea party with Yuto, Beast hurts her. Satsuki requires it to attack Inogashira.</p> <p>Satsuki let Beast finish the work whereas she goes with Yuto. Beast launches a huge attack in order to achieve Arashi. But a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43431\" href=\"/gohodoji/4015-43431/\" slug=\"gohodoji\">gohodoji</a> appears and receives the attack instead. Kamui arrives with a badly wounded Sorata. Arashi understands that the gohodoji belongs to Sorata. Arashi doesnât support this scene. Sorata is happy to see Arashi healthy. Kamui requires Arashi to cancel her kekkai in order to help Sorata. She does it whereas Beast observes jealously Satsuki.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <p> </p><blockquote>Powers and Abilities</blockquote> <p><strong><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">High Jump</span></strong><br/><br/>Like every dragon, Fuma could jump the high of a building.<br/><br/><strong><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Computer Control<br/><br/></span></strong>Satsuki has a natural capacity to communicate with computers. <br/><br/><strong><span style=\"TEXT-DECORATION: underline\">Intelligence</span></strong><br/><br/>Satsuki is very smart.

    "description": "<p>Tokyo Babylon</p><p>X/1999</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As the Sakurazukamori and a Dragon of Earth Seichiro has a number of supernatural abilities. Most of his abilities are similar to Subaru Sumeragi and onmyogji in general. He can create psywaves powerful enough to crush concrete, or focused enough to act like a bullet. He can call upon shikigami or familiar spirits to attack with or act as spies and often take the form of black ravens. He can form shields in the shape of a reverse pentagram to protect himself. He is agile enough to jump the height of a typical building a traverse rooftops with ease and can use levitation to slow falls. His most notable ability as the sakurazukamori is the ability to cast illusions to such a degree that he can fool even the other Dragons. As a trained assassin Seichiro is skilled in hand to hand combat and favors impaling his target with his arm.</p><p>The Seichiro in Tsubasa displays different abilities. He can travel dimensions thanks to the magical eye given to him by Yuko. He is a skilled fighter having trained himself despite his lack of peripheral vision. After gaining Sakura's feather he gains the ability to summon demons and form them to his will, often forming them into blades and shields to use. Seichiro with his demons was able to go one on one with Kurogane for an extended period with both complimenting the others skill.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p>Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles - An alternate version of Seichiro appears travelling dimensions as a treasure and vampire hunter. In particular he had been hunting a pair of vampires who were alternate versions of Kamui Shiro and Subaru Sumeragi. Seichiro received the ability to travel dimensions by trading his right eye (the same one he loses in Tokyo Babylon) to the Dimensional witch Yuko Ichihara.</p><p>Seichiro travelled to Clow Country in his journeys and met a young Syaoran who was being accosted by thugs for a book on vampires. Seichiro defeats the thugs and then gets Syaoran's trust to read the book. In exchange for Syaoran translating the script Seichiro teaches Syaoran how to fight, using a kicking style to optimize Syaoran's field of vision.</p><p>Seichiro doesn't meet Syaoran again until after his journey to collect Sakura's feathers starts. He appears in Oto Country with a feather and manipulates the demons oh that world in order to meet the A1 demon who he believed was one of the vampire twins he hunted. This turned out to be false and Oto Country was actually a virtual RPG. Seichiro appeared to kill both Fay D Flourite and Syaoran though he knew the nature of the virtual world. After going toe to toe with Kurogane Seichiro disappeared with the feather he had collected.</p><p>Seichiro's next appearance is in Nihon Country (Feudal Japan) after Syaoran is revealed to be a clone and the original Tsubasa Li has joined the group. He materializes before the main cast plus Princess Tomoyo, her sister Amaterasu, the ninja Soma, and his dimension travelling treasure hunter younger brother Fuma (alternate version of Fuma Mono). Seichiro interrogates Fay on his new vampire status and on the location of the vampire twins. After Tsubasa challenges Seichiro for the feather in his possession. Tomoyo creates a kekkai barrier for them to fight in so they don't damage the castle. The fight is vicious but Tsubasa claims the feather. Fuma states that this is what Seichiro wanted. He leaves for the next world to continue his hunt.</p>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Seiichiro Aoki was born in a family of kazetsukai who control the wind. In order to optimize his power, a kazetsukai must have a person you love to protect. Due to his abilities of seal, even if he hadnât a person he loved, the young man Seiichiro was already the best kazetsukai of his clan. That was why <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> admired him and spent a lot of time with his uncle. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Meet the Other Seals</p><p>==================</p> <p>Years past, Seiichiro felt in love and married with Shimako. He had a girl with her who called Yuka. He became a copy editor at Kadoka Shoten. A day he had a report to write about <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43433\" href=\"/soaplands-of-shinjuku/4020-43433/\" slug=\"soaplands-of-shinjuku\">soaplands of Shinjuku</a>. He met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a> and became friends. </p><p>One day, Seiichiro goes to his work place and falls on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a> in front of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a>.  Arashi learnt from a telepathic conversation with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a> that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a> was stolen by one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. She feels something but not hostility. At this moment, several men in black who reveal to be <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43423\" href=\"/shiki/4015-43423/\" slug=\"shiki\">shiki</a> make their appearance. For security, Arashi creates a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a>. Seiichiro was imprisoned in this kekkai. He decides to fight with her against the Shiki. Arashi uses her saber to fight them whereas Seiichiro uses his wind abilities. After the destruction of Shiki, Arashi cancels her kekkai. Seiichiro receives a call from his chief telling him he is late. Seiichiro must leave; so he introduces himself as one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>, lets a visit card and goes to work. </p><p>He meets also <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a>, discusses a little and lets to her a visit card. Days past, Yuzuriha calls him to take an appointment with him and Daisuke. She was surprised he changed his work. Indeed, now he works for Asuka. Daisuke and Yuzuhira arrive at Yasukuni Shrine. Seiichiro joins them. Yuzuhira and Seiichiro tease Daisuke. Moreover, Seiichiro reveals he is Daisukeâs uncle. Daisuke brings them back to a serious discussion and talks about the last destroyed kekkai. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Incapacity to Help</p><p>=================</p> <p>When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> chooses to become a seal, Seiichiro and the other seals fells something is wrong at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a>. After killing his sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> wants to kill Kamui. Fuma tries to retire the sacred sword. But <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43376\" href=\"/kakyo-kuzuki/4005-43376/\" slug=\"kakyo-kuzuki\">Kakyo Kuzuki</a> takes possession of Kotoriâs corpse and stops him. Kotori doesnât want her brother to kill Kamui. Arashi, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a>, Yuzuhira, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43371\" href=\"/inuki/4005-43371/\" slug=\"inuki\">Inuki</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a>, Seiichiro and Daisuke arrive and see this awful scene. Fuma dismembers his sister and runs away without the sacred sword. Kamui doesnât support the situation. Once again, a person he loves was killed. </p><p>Seiichiro only can stay with seals. Itâs Subaru who succeeds to bring back Kamui. Kotori was buried inside Clamp School. Kamui remembers his old memories in front of Kotoriâs grave. Sorata arrives, hugs Kamui and tries to comfort him. The other seals do their appearance, even Karen Kasumi. She is surprise to see an old acquaintance in the person of Seiichiro Aoki. Karen introduces herself to Kamui. She delivers him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\">Tokiko Magami</a>âs message: to bring the sacred sword at the heart of Clamp School. It is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\">Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\">Suo Takamura</a> do their appearance. They will show them the emplacement to protect the sacred sword.</p><p>Nokoru, Akira, Suo and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a> arrive at a fountain in the center of Clamp School. Nokoru asks Kamui to put his hand on the symbol of the school. Kamui does it and a secret passage is opened. Seiichiro sees Kamui seals the sacred sword whereas <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a> steals the other one to bring it to Fuma.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Friendship</p><p>============</p> <p>Time elapsed. Daisuke was killed by Fuma and Shinjuku was destroyed. Karen calls Seiichiro at her apartment and prepares a tea for him. They talk about Shinjuku and the last events. She offers her condolences for the death of Daisuke. Seiichiro explains he must not be sad because Daisuke it was his wish to die for Hinoto. For Karen, it is impossible to not cry the persons you lost. They learn at television that the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43401\" href=\"/yamanote-line/4020-43401/\" slug=\"yamanote-line\">Yamanote Line</a> is attacked. Karen wants to go alone because Seiichiro has a family and the other seals are too young. Seiichiro disagrees with her and wants to go too. But Karen has prepared this possibility. She put sleeping pills on his tea and tells him no one will cry for her death. Seiichiro doesnât want to stay without doing anything. He cuts his legs in order to cancel the sleeping pillsâ effects. He goes at Yamanote line, enters the kekkai and finds Karen fighting Yuto. He attacks him, but Yuto proposes to cancel their fight in order to take care of their injured partner. Karen accepts the draw and disrupts her kekkai. She requires Seiichiro some explanations. He answers that he would cry if Karen dies. She thanks him.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Karenâs Request</p><p>================</p><p>Days past, Karen is sad to see Yamanote line destroyed. She was created this kekkai. She met Seiichiro. She asks if his family is safe. Seiichiro says everyone is ok. She is glad to hear that. Karen redoes her promise to not fight alone. They feel a new earthquake. Karen tries to stop Nataku; but he succeeds to destroy a new kekkai. Even if he is an angel, Karen sees in him an innocent child. Tokyo is on ruin. Karen is wondering if Nataku is the responsible. But even if he is an angel, she is worried about his sadness. Seiichiro arrives and apologizes to be late. Karen is amused because Seiichiro doesnât wear his costume like always. He apologizes; but Karen is glad to see another face of Seiichiro. They go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a>. The true Hinoto still tries unsuccessfully to stop the dark Hinoto. Karen and Seiichiro arrive. She tells them that the next target is Ginza. They decide to go alone at the great joy of Hinoto.</p><p>Karen and Seiichiro arrive at Ginza. A feeling of danger surrounds the place. Karen creates a kekkai and asks Seiichiro to do the same. She wants to be sure that place wonât be destroyed. It is at this moment that Nataku attacks Ginza. When he sees that is Karen is opponent, Nataku is sad. But his duty is to destroy the kekkai, so he attacks them. They dodge each attack and they are wondering why Nataku launches always the same attack. Nataku begs Karen to leave the place. For Karen, this request is a proof that Nataku has feelings. He explains to her that he is a clone and he always heard he has no soul and no feelings. Karen understands because she lived the same thing with her mother. Seiichiro tries to intervene, but he is stopped by Karen. She asks Nataku if he knows what do the seven angels. He reveals that he had some information by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43375\" href=\"/tomoharu-tojyo/4005-43375/\" slug=\"tomoharu-tojyo\">Tomoharu Tojyo</a>. He said a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> told him that his grand-daughter would die twice and would be concern by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. That was why he asked Nataku to steal the sacred sword in order to be sure he would not die. Karen is happy to learn that there is a person who loves him. She asks him why he joined the dragon of Earth. He explains he wants to be with Fuma. It is another proof that Nataku has feelings because he loves Fuma. It is at this moment that Fuma does his entrance. For Karen, he looks like Seiichiro, her dearest person. Fuma sees that Nataku has another wish. That is why he wants to check which one is the more important. He attacks Karen, but Nataku saves her. Fuma requires Nataku to leave, but Karen tells him to follow his heart. He takes his decision. So Fuma launches a massive attack. Seiichiro dodges it, but it is the intervention of Nataku which permits to Karen to not be injured. Fuma stares at them. Karen asks Nataku to let her, but he doesnât want. He knows that Karen has no chance with Fuma. He stays to protect Karen and Fuma kills him. Nataku has just the time to say that the Yumemi Tomoharu Tojyo saw was Hinoto. Karen argues Fuma to explain this. Fuma explains that was the dearest wish of Nataku: to die for his dearest person by the person he loves. Nataku assimilates Karen as his mother and Fuma as his father. Karen doesnât understand why he killed Nataku if he knew that. Fuma thinks everyone must have their wish realized. Some people like Karen wish to die for someone, others have a different wish. For Karen, it is intolerable to kill someone. For Fuma it is necessary if they want to take care of their dearest thing. Karen becomes completely mad and attacks Fuma. But he is too strong.

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Karen Kasumi was born to a faithful mother. Karen learnt quickly to control her power to create fire. When her mother saw that, she considered her like a daemon. She isolated them into a church. She often hit her daughter and told her she would prefer to not have her. Karen had only a teddy bear for friend. The religious men tried to convince her mother to let them take care of Karen. They could teach her how to use her power to help people. She refused. One day, her mother wounded Karen too much. An ambulance was called. Her mother didnât want to let her daughter, yelled in the middle of the street and was hit by a car. Karen waked up at hospital and learnt her motherâs death. She was sad because her mother was the only person who cried for her.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Meets</p><p>=========</p> <p>Years past, Karen learnt by religious how to use her power correctly and her destiny to be a seal. She becomes very faithful, but she has also a free mind. Indeed she decides to be a hostess in a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43433\" href=\"/soaplands-of-shinjuku/4020-43433/\" slug=\"soaplands-of-shinjuku\">soaplands of Shinjuku</a>. Her work permits her to meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a>, another <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a>. She really appreciates him and they become friends.</p><p>Karen sees regularly <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a>âs house whose belong now to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43352\" href=\"/tokiko-magami/4005-43352/\" slug=\"tokiko-magami\">Tokiko Magami</a>. One day men in black kidnap Tokiko. She sees Karen, asks her to burn her house and launches a spell on Karen. Karen executes her order and burns the house. She observes the arrival of Kamui, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a> astonished to see this. She let them leave the place. </p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Introduction</p><p>=============</p> <p>Days past, Karen decides to enter in contact with other seals. She often returns to Kamuiâs home hoping she finds a dragon of Heaven. One day she finds Sorata and Arashi talking together. Karen, lightly dressed enters in the conversation. She explains she just left her work to bring a message to Kamui from Tokiko. She reveals she burnt Tokikoâs house at her demand. She introduces herself as Karen Kasumi, one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a>. She tells them to say to Kamui to protect the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43403\" href=\"/sacred-sword/4055-43403/\" slug=\"sacred-sword\">Sacred Sword</a>. She must return to her work. Sorata asks her which Shrine she comes from. Karen, amused, tells him that she comes from the Flower, lets Sorata a visit card and leaves them into a flame show. The card reveals that the Flower is a soapland. </p><p>With her destiny to be a seal, Karen feels each important event: the destruction of a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> for instance. So she feels when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> wakes up as Kamui and feels the death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a>. Kotori was buried inside <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43395\" href=\"/clamp-school/4020-43395/\" slug=\"clamp-school\">Clamp School</a>. Sorata arrives, hugs Kamui and tries to comfort him. The other seals do their appearance, even Karen Kasumi. She is surprise to see an old acquaintance in the person of Seiichiro Aoki. Karen introduces herself to Kamui. She delivers him Tokikoâs message: to bring the sacred sword at the heart of Clamp School. It is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43379\" href=\"/akira-iyuin/4005-43379/\" slug=\"akira-iyuin\">Akira Iyuin</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43380\" href=\"/suo-takamura/4005-43380/\" slug=\"suo-takamura\">Suo Takamura</a> do their appearance. They will show them the emplacement to protect the sacred sword. Karen follows them and Kamui seals the sacred sword.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Fire and Water</p><p>===============</p> <p>Three months past, Shinjuku was destroyed and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> is dead. Karen calls Seiichiro at her apartment and prepares a tea for him. They talk about Shinjuku and the last events. She offers her condolences for the death of Daisuke. Seiichiro explains he must not be sad because it was his wish to die for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a>. For Karen, it is impossible to not cry the persons you lost. They learn at television that the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43401\" href=\"/yamanote-line/4020-43401/\" slug=\"yamanote-line\">Yamanote Line</a> is attacked. Karen wants to go alone because Seiichiro has a family and the other seals are too young. Seiichiro disagrees with her and wants to go too. But Karen has prepared this possibility. She put sleeping pills on his tea and tells him no one will cry for her death. Karen arrives at Yamanote line, creates a kekkai and attacks <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a>. With her pyrokinetic powers, Karen beats easily Nataku. She asks him why he did that. He explains he has no feelings. She replies everyone has feelings. That is at this moment that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43350\" href=\"/yuto-kigai/4005-43350/\" slug=\"yuto-kigai\">Yuto Kigai</a> attacks with his hydrokinetic powers. Like before, Yuto jokes with his opponent. The fight is intense and no one take the advantage. Seiichiro does his entrance in order to help Karen. He hurts himself his leg in order to diminish the effect of the sleeping pills. Yuto proposes to cancel their fight in order to take care of their injured partner. Karen accepts the draw and disrupts her kekkai. She requires Seiichiro some explanations. He answers that he would cry if Karen dies. She thanks him.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Friendship</p><p>============</p><p>Days later, Fuma succeeds to destroy Yamanote line. Karen is sad to see Yamanote line destroyed. She was created this kekkai. She met Seiichiro. She asks if his family is safe. She is glad to hear that. Karen redoes her promise to not fight alone. They feel a new earthquake. Karen tries to stop Nataku; but he succeeds to destroy a new kekkai. Even if he is an angel, Karen sees in him an innocent child.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Like a Son</p><p>============</p> <p>Tokyo is on ruin. Karen is wondering if Nataku is the responsible. But even if he is an angel, she is worried about his sadness. Seiichiro arrives and apologises to be late. Karen is amused because Seiichiro doesnât wear his costume like always. He apologises; but Karen is glad to see another face of Seiichiro. They go to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43392\" href=\"/diet-building/4020-43392/\" slug=\"diet-building\">Diet Building</a>. The true Hinoto still tries unsuccessfully to stop the dark Hinoto. Karen and Seiichiro arrive. She tells them that the next target is Ginza. They decide to go alone at the great joy of Hinoto.</p><p>Karen and Seiichiro arrive at Ginza. A feeling of danger surrounds the place. Karen creates a kekkai and asks Seiichiro to do the same. She wants to be sure that place wonât be destroyed. It is at this moment that Nataku attacks Ginza. When he sees that is Karen is opponent, Nataku is sad. But his duty is to destroy the kekkai, so he attacks them. They dodge each attack and they are wondering why Nataku launches always the same attack. Nataku begs Karen to leave the place. For Karen, this request is a proof that Nataku has feelings. He explains to her that he is a clone and he always heard he has no soul and no feelings. Karen understands because she lived the same thing with her mother. Seiichiro tries to intervene, but he is stopped by Karen. She asks Nataku if he knows what do the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43408\" href=\"/seven-angels/4060-43408/\" slug=\"seven-angels\">Seven Angels</a>. He reveals that he had some information by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43375\" href=\"/tomoharu-tojyo/4005-43375/\" slug=\"tomoharu-tojyo\">Tomoharu Tojyo</a>. He said a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43389\" href=\"/yumemi/4015-43389/\" slug=\"yumemi\">Yumemi</a> told him that his grand-daughter would die twice and would be concern by the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. That was why he asked Nataku to steal the sacred sword in order to be sure he would not die. Karen is happy to learn that there is a person who loves him. She asks him why he joined the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. He explains he wants to be with Fuma. It is another proof that Nataku has feelings because he loves Fuma. It is at this moment that Fuma does his entrance. For Karen, he looks like Seiichiro, her dearest person. Fuma sees that Nataku has another wish. That is why he wants to check which one is the more important. He attacks Karen, but Nataku saves her. Fuma requires Nataku to leave, but Karen tells him to follow his heart. He takes his decision. So Fuma launches a massive attack. Seiichiro dodges it, but it is the intervention of Nataku which permits to Karen to not be injured. Fuma stares at them. Karen asks Nataku to let her, but he doesnât want. He knows that Karen has no chance with Fuma. He stays to protect Karen and Fuma kills him. Nataku has just the time to say that the yumemi Tomoharu Tojyo saw was Hinoto. Karen argues Fuma to explain this. Fuma explains that was the dearest wish of Nataku: to die for his dearest person by the person he loves. Nataku assimilates Karen as his mother and Fuma as his father. Karen doesnât understand why he killed Nataku if he knew that. Fuma thinks everyone must have their wish realised. Some people like Karen wish to die for someone, others have a different wish. For Karen, it is intolerable to kill someone. For Fuma it is necessary if they want to take care of their dearest thing. Karen becomes completely mad and attacks Fuma. But he is too strong. Fuma decides to leave in order to respect Natakuâs wish. Moreover he lets Natakuâs corpse to Karen because he knows she will take care of him.</p><p>Karen buried Nataku near Kotori. Kamui joins Karen. She explains she considered Nataku like her child. She is sad as Fuma is. She reveals to Kamui that Fuma said the more a person is important for us, the more we hurt him. Karen tells Kamui to question Fuma the next time he will see him. Kamui has come to ask a question. He asks her if Tokikoâs kidnappers are some men in black. She confirms it at the great despair of Kamui. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Jour de la Promesse</p><p>===================</p><p>The âjour de la promesseâ arrives when Kamui unseals the sacred sword.

Through <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43366\" href=\"/satsuki-yatoji/4005-43366/\" slug=\"satsuki-yatoji\">Satsuki Yatoji</a> sees Yuzuriha attacking with Inuki electrical cables and decides to have a talk with her. By the intermediary of a giant screen, Satsuki introduces herself as one of the dragons of Earth. Yuzuriha asks her why she accepts to destroy buildings where people are. Satsuki returns the question saying why not killing people. She thinks human being is an animal like others. Because he is superior to others, he can kill everything he wants. But angels are superior to humans. So why cannot she kill people? Yuzuriha doesnât find any answer. Satsuki attacks her, but sacrifice itself in order to protect Yuzuriha. She doesnât support this sacrifice, tears in tears and faints. The kekkai is dissipated. Hopefully, Kusanagi is there to rescue her.</p><p>Yuzuriha wakes up at the military hospital of Ichigawa where Kusanagi brought her. She asks for Shinjuku. Kusanagi responds that Shinjuku is completely destroyed. Yuzuriha cries because she thinks she is responsible of the death of Inuki and the destruction of Shinjuku. She didnât answer, so they died. Kusanagi says she is the answer: People would cry if people are killed. He proposes her to take a rest and stays with her.</p><p>Near <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43400\" href=\"/tokyo-tower/4020-43400/\" slug=\"tokyo-tower\">Tokyo Tower</a>, Kusanagi is also worried about Yuzuriha. She is happy of her clothes bought by Kusanagi because it is gift by the person she loves. She understands she is too young to be loved by him; but she wants to know more about him. He is glad of that and agrees to know more about each other. Yuzuriha must leave and join the other seals. Kusanagi is disoriented because is a dragon of Earth whereas Yuzuriha is a dragon of Heaven.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>High Jump</p><p>Like every dragon, Kusanagi could jump the high of a building.</p><p><br/></p><p>Shirahadori</p><p>Kusanagi knows soldier techniques like Shirahadori.</p><p><br/></p><p>Hadoken</p><p>Kusanagi could use psionic attack like hadoken.</p><p><br/></p><p>Chikyuwari</p><p>Kusanagi uses his strength to break the ground.</p><p><br/></p><p>Telepathy</p><p>Kusanagi can communicate with the fauna and the flora.</p><br/>",

    "description": "<p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Tomoharu was a smart scientist and he created <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43390\" href=\"/tojyo-pharmaceutical/4020-43390/\" slug=\"tojyo-pharmaceutical\">Tojyo Pharmaceutical</a>. He had a son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43377\" href=\"/masaki-tojyo/4005-43377/\" slug=\"masaki-tojyo\">Masaki Tojyo</a> who had a daughter Kazuki. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a> predicted her that she would die twice for the Earth. Kazuki had a congenital disease and was condemned to die. Her father and grandfather tried to find a remedy to heal her. But they didnât succeed and Kazuki died. Masaki promised her that he would bring her back.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Rebirth</p><p>==========</p><p><br/></p><p>Years past; Masaki and Tomoharu succeeded to clone partially Kazuki. In order to achieve the cloning and remembering his promise, Masaki sacrificed himself. The cloning was completed. Tomoharu didnât see in the clone his grand-daughter. Indeed the clone had no sex; he is a combination between a man and a woman. Tomoharu considered that the clone had no soul. He decided to nickname him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43365\" href=\"/nataku/4005-43365/\" slug=\"nataku\">Nataku</a>. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Sacred Sword</p><p>===============</p> <p>Tomoharu learnt from Hinoto that the sacred sword is the key of the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â. So he decides to steal it in order to protect Nataku. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> comes back to Tokyo, Tomoharu can detect the sacred sword at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43402\" href=\"/togakushi-shrine/4020-43402/\" slug=\"togakushi-shrine\">Togakushi Shrine</a>. He asks Nataku to steal it. </p><p>Nataku goes, steals it and brings it back to Tomoharu. </p><p>At the Tojyo Pharmaceutical inside the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43397\" href=\"/sunshine-60/4020-43397/\" slug=\"sunshine-60\">Sunshine 60</a>, Nataku is stabilized in a serum whereas Tomoharu Tojyo explains Nataku is a genetic creation, an artificial human being created for the âjour de la promesseâ. He interrogates his employees to know which information they find on the sacred sword. The only information they have is that the sacred sword is alive.</p><p>Another sacred sword does its appearance. Nataku feels the call of the swords. This calls become more and more important. One day, Nataku decides to help the sacred sword he stole. He breaks free and takes the sword to bring it to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> at the great despair of Tomoharu. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Nataku</p><p>=========</p> <p>Days past; Sunshine 60 is attacked by Nataku. For his grand-father, it confirms that Nataku has no soul. Fuma joins them and asks Nataku to achieve Tomoharu Tojyo. Nataku is ready to do it when Fuma stops him when he feels the presence of Kamui. On the roof, Kamui finds Fuma. Fuma tells him he must create a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> if he wants to protect people. He goes to attack him, but Fuma shows him Tomoharu Tojyo. Fuma attacks Kamui knowing he will protect the old man. Fuma is ready to finish him when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> arrives and creates a kekkai. To destroy the building, the kekkai must disappear. And to make a kekkai disappear, one of the ways is to kill the kekkaiâs creator. So Nataku attacks Subaru, but Subaru is too strong. Understanding that, Fuma decides to finish the battle and asks Nataku to leave. Nataku accepts and goes away. Fuma destroys the kekkai. Kamui has just the time to save Tomoharu. He is hospitalized inside Tojyo Laboratories at Shinjuku. He receives the visit of Kamui and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a>. He thanks Kamui to have saved him. Kamui asks why Fuma was there. Tomoharu explains that Sunshine 60 is a kekkai. He explains also that Nataku is a clone of his grand-daughter and his son. </p><p>Shinjuku is attacked and completely destroyed by <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43406\" href=\"/beast/4055-43406/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a>. Tomoharu probably died with the destruction of Shinjuku.</p><p><br/></p>",

    "description": "<br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Origin</p><p>=========</p><p>Kakyo was born with the ability of a yumemi. In consequence he had a very weak health. His mother closed him in a little room and used his powers to help the mafia. Kakyo felt alone because he saw nobody. One day a young woman entered into his dream. She introduced herself as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43372\" href=\"/hokuto-sumeragi/4005-43372/\" slug=\"hokuto-sumeragi\">Hokuto Sumeragi</a>. Hokuto was a smiling girl. She guessed that is Kakyoâs dream and so he is a yumemi. She revealed, contrary to her brother, she had only the capacity to introduce into dreams. Seeing that Kakyo is always in his room, Hokuto proposes him to get out. She brought him in her dream near the sea. </p><p>Kakyo saw regularly Hokuto in his dreams; but he saw also the future. He knew she would be killed by the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43428\" href=\"/sakurazukamori/4015-43428/\" slug=\"sakurazukamori\">sakurazukamori</a> under a cherry tree. Even if he knew that the destiny is foreordained, Kakyo decided to try to help Hokuto. He escaped; but his health worsened. He faint near the scene where Hokuto was killed. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Kotori Mono</p><p>==============</p> <p>Kakyo cannot do anything now. He is hospitalized and maintained alive by machines. He cannot speak or walk anymore. He can only dream. <br/></p><p>Kakyo looks othersâ dream and find <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43358\" href=\"/kotori-mono/4005-43358/\" slug=\"kotori-mono\">Kotori Mono</a> falling under the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43391\" href=\"/sea-of-tears/4020-43391/\" slug=\"sea-of-tears\">Sea of Tears</a>. She sinks more and more; but she is saved by Kakyo. He explains they are both yumemi. Kotori tries to come near him. He brings them near the sea. They introduce themselves. He tells her that his heart is dead because the person he wants to see is dead. Kotoriâs enters in harmony with Kakyoâs one. A <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43345\" href=\"/kamui-shiro/4005-43345/\" slug=\"kamui-shiro\">Kamui Shiro</a> with an angel wing and a devil wing appears. Kakyo stops this and Kamui disappears. He reveals that the twin star of Kamui will wake up soon and that a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43432\" href=\"/kekkai/4015-43432/\" slug=\"kekkai\">kekkai</a> in Nakano will be destroyed very soon. And his prediction comes true. </p><p>Kakyo has another vision. There are two sacred swords: one for Kamui and one for Kamuiâs twin star. He sees also the death of Kotori. Knowing that she doesnât want the death of Kamui, Kakyo controls Kotoriâs corpse and stops <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43353\" href=\"/fuma-mono/4005-43353/\" slug=\"fuma-mono\">Fuma Mono</a> Mono trying to kill Kamui. </p><p>Kotori does an ultimate dream with Kakyo. She explains she didnât want her brother to kill Kamui because if he did that, Fuma couldnât return to his normal behaviour. She apologizes to have used Kakyo. He doesnât care because he knows he will become a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a>. He regrets to not save her. She accepted to self-sacrifice in order to protect Kamui and the Earth. Kotori must leave. Angel wings grow on her back. Kakyo is sad because he will never see Kotori anymore. She has a message for Kamui and Fuma: she loves them and the future is not foreordained. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Seven Angels</p><p>=================</p> <p>In the reality, Fuma breaks in a chamber of the Four Season Hotel. It is the chamber of Kakyo who brings Fuma in a dream. He shows him the message that Kotori let. Fuma doesnât care. For him, there is only one future and it is foreordained. Upset, the other Kamui destroys the dream, catches Kakyo and leaves the place. </p><p>Fuma asks Kakyo what is his wish. He responds he wants to die. Fuma tells him he will realize his wish when the â<a data-ref-id=\"4045-43388\" href=\"/jour-de-la-promesse/4045-43388/\" slug=\"jour-de-la-promesse\">Jour de la Promesse</a>â begin. Fuma brings Kakyo to the City Hall. Fuma introduces himself and Kakyo to others. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>The Seven Seals</p><p>================</p> <p>Kakyo enters in contact with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43349\" href=\"/hinoto/4005-43349/\" slug=\"hinoto\">Hinoto</a> several times. He tells her he knows she sees what happened before it was realized. Moreover he reveals he knows she lies to others in order to realize her wish. He reveals he knows that Hinoto brought together the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43409\" href=\"/dragons-of-heaven/4060-43409/\" slug=\"dragons-of-heaven\">Dragons of Heaven</a> in order to modify the future for her own interest. He shows him the last vision of Kotori. </p><p>When Hinoto tries to convince Kamui that dragons of Heaven are there to save the Earth, Kakyo decides to intervene. He shows Kamui the two possible futures: the rebirth of the Earth in case of the victory of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43410\" href=\"/dragons-of-earth/4060-43410/\" slug=\"dragons-of-earth\">Dragons of Earth</a> or the death of the Earth due to global warming in case of the victory of the Dragons of Heaven. </p><p>Kakyo still dream about the future in order to help Fuma. He sees everything; even the fight between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43362\" href=\"/subaru-sumeragi/4005-43362/\" slug=\"subaru-sumeragi\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43367\" href=\"/seichiro-sakurazuka/4005-43367/\" slug=\"seichiro-sakurazuka\">Seichiro Sakurazuka</a> and the incapacity of Kamui to protect him. He thinks Kamui must change if he wants to bring back Fuma. Moreover, he thinks the future is foreordained except if the human beings donât have wishes.</p><p>Kakyo remembers Hinoto how <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43360\" href=\"/daisuke-saiki/4005-43360/\" slug=\"daisuke-saiki\">Daisuke Saiki</a> is dead. Fuma attacked Daisuke. Hinoto tried to protect him. Fuma decided to eliminate both. Daisuke sacrificed himself in order to protect his mistress. Kakyo tells her once again, she could not change the future.</p><p>Kamui has a conversation with Kakyo in a dream. Kamui tells him he wants to be stronger than Fuma in order to bring him back. He is ready to hurt him if it is necessary because he doesnât want Fuma to continue to kill. Kakyo reveals that Fuma is the dark side of Kamui and everyone has dark and bright sides. He says also that Kamui must be careful because one of his allies hides her dark side. Kamui asks why he tries to help him. Kakyo answers he hopes that Kotoriâs last message is true. Fuma joins Kakyo in his dream. He tells him that the future must not change if Kakyo wants his wish realized. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Hokuto and Hinoto</p><p>===================</p> <p>Kakyo dreams about an old memory about Hokuto Sumeragi. Kakyo remembers the first time he met Hokuto. </p><p>The dark Hinoto visits Kakyo in his dream to reveals he was right about her and also Hinoto was wrong. She will not be killed by Kamui and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43407\" href=\"/seven-seals/4060-43407/\" slug=\"seven-seals\">Seven Seals</a> will die. The entire scene is seen by Fuma. Whereas Fuma catches Kakyo to bring him where Hokuto died, Hinoto is happy to see her plan realized. The dark Hinoto is amused by the situation whereas the real Hinoto asks Kakyo to stop the other Hinoto. Kakyo responds it is impossible because the destiny is foreordained.</p><p>Kakyo remembers the day when Hokuto was killed. Hokuto reveals she wants to be killed instead of her brother. Seichiro doesnât understand. Hokuto explains she knows they loves each other and she wants they live together forever because everybody has the right to love and to be loved. Fuma arrives and tells Kakyo that the destiny is foreordained. It was her destiny to die as it is the destiny that a dragon of Heaven will replace a dragon of Earth.</p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Fuma Mono</p><p>=============</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43378\" href=\"/nokoru-imonoyama/4005-43378/\" slug=\"nokoru-imonoyama\">Nokoru Imonoyama</a> explains to the seals that it is impossible to know the next target; because if they go to a kekkai, Fuma will learn by the intermediary of his yumemi and will attack another one. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43346\" href=\"/sorata-arisugawa/4005-43346/\" slug=\"sorata-arisugawa\">Sorata Arisugawa</a> decides to separate in three groups of two: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43351\" href=\"/arashi-kishu/4005-43351/\" slug=\"arashi-kishu\">Arashi Kishu</a> / <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43374\" href=\"/yuzuriha-nekoi/4005-43374/\" slug=\"yuzuriha-nekoi\">Yuzuriha Nekoi</a>, Sorata / Kamui, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43369\" href=\"/karen-kasumi/4005-43369/\" slug=\"karen-kasumi\">Karen Kasumi</a> / <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43368\" href=\"/seiichiro-aoki/4005-43368/\" slug=\"seiichiro-aoki\">Seiichiro Aoki</a>. Kakyo learns that through his dream and tells Fuma that the dragons of Heaven will go at Inokashira and Ginza.</p><p>Kamui is wondering about himself. Indeed every seal knows how to create a kekkai because they have something to protect. But him, even if he wants to protect Fuma, he cannot create a kekkai. This scene is seen by Fuma with the help of Kakyo. Fuma knows the solution. If Kamui cannot create kekkai is because his dearest wish isnât to protect Fuma. He consoles also Kakyo telling him he will die soon; but before that they must welcomed a new angel. </p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Hinotoâs request</p><p>================</p> <p><br/></p><p>Whereas the dark Hinoto sends a shiki in order to confirm the death of Karen and Seiichiro, the true Hinoto discusses with Kakyo. He doesnât understand why the dark Hinoto doesnât find the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43430\" href=\"/goho/4015-43430/\" slug=\"goho\">goho</a>. Hinoto responds that the two Hinoto are linked. As the true Hinoto is hurt in her heart, the dark Hinoto is also hurt in her heart. That is why she doesnât find the goho. Kakyo advises her to be careful if she wants to not die. She answers she wants first that the seals know the truth about the dark Hinoto. Kakyo reminds her that will be difficult because the future is realizing. The only way is that Kamui finds the most cherished wish of Fuma if he wants to change the future. Kakyo is desperate to see that his visions come true.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Powers and Abilities</p><p>==================</p><p>Yumemi</p><p>Kakyo can see the future, see peopleâs dreams, bring people into a dream, show them a vision and see everyone everywhere.</p><p><br/></p><p>Possession</p><p>Kakyo can control corpses.</p><br/>",

El Guapo was soon killed by a curse that was put on him by Henrietta Hunter, which caused his skateboard to impale him.</p><p>His power was apparently focussed through his skateboard, which moved at his mental command and sometimes acted out his subconscious thoughts, as when the skateboard beat him up for cheating on his girlfriend.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Asteroth is an evil being that creates chaos through feeding on order. Asteroth was imprisoned in a Cosmic Hell, a celestial domain where beings of hate and destruction were exiled. It was Asteroth's own race that placed her there. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7491\" href=\"/stardust/4005-7491/\">Stardust</a> used the ability to warp space and open a portal to this domain in order to defeat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6139\" href=\"/beta-ray-bill/4005-6139/\">Beta Ray Bill</a>. In Bill's struggle to escape the pull of the vortex, he freed a something from the realm. This was merely a portion of Asteroth, who easily defeated Stardust and Bill. She then went to gain more power by creating fear and chaos. Not whole, Asteroth started small, by destroying planets. Stardust knew that eventually this would turn into star systems then galaxies and so on. Eventually Asteroth would move from universe to universe, destroying all in her path. Stardust and Bill formed an uneasy alliance to stop her from destroying their universe.</p><p>Stardust attempted to create a black hole in order to trap Asteroth, but she was immune to the gravity and turned it on Stardust and Bill. As they battled with Asteroth, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40974\" href=\"/alpha-ray/4005-40974/\">Alpha Ray</a> appeared and helped to push her into the black hole. Or so it seemed. Beta Ray Bill returned to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\" href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\">Asgard</a>, only to find it destroyed from Ragnarok. He had planned to find a place here for the remainder of his people, which were all located in a small device known as the Meta-Orb. But out of the Orb came the form of a Korbinite. Asteroth had used the Orb as a lifeboat and claimed to have killed every Korbinite inside. Asteroth was now mortal, giving herself the name Omega Ray. She appeared to have power equal to Bill's, but his fury was unmatched. He was able to destroy her once and for all.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Asteroth is a <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">Marvel comic</a> book character created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-2994\" href=\"/michael-avon-oeming/4040-2994/\">Michael Avon Oeming,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4040-57633\" href=\"/dan-berman/4040-57633/\">Dan Berman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-13287\" href=\"/andrea-divito/4040-13287/\">Andrea Divito.</a> The character first appears in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-20565\" href=\"/stormbreaker-the-saga-of-beta-ray-bill/4050-20565/\">Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill #3</a> released in 2005. The name of Asteroth and many of its variations are common in demonology and as such a reoccurring theme and name in fiction.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fear Itself</h3><p>Asteroth can be seen as one of the demons at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57910\" href=\"/the-infinite-embassy/4020-57910/\">The Infinite Embassy</a>, more precisely she was at the Devil's Advocacy, inside the Embassy, arguing with the other demons who should be the true Satan.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Asteroth was a massive cosmic entity, that had been trapped into a dimension of dark nothingness. A small fractional aspect of it manifested as a humanoid female that possessed incredible degrees of strength, speed, stamina, energy projection and durability, to the extent to enable her to fight a herald of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\" href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\">Galactus</a> and the Korbinite warrior Beta Ray Bill simultaneously. This fraction of power was able to destroy planets as well as feed on planets</p>",

    "deck": "Henrietta Hunter was a mutant member of the X-Statix who has died multiple times, but unexplicably returns with new powers.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Henrietta Hunter was a Europan pop star with the mutant ability of empathy. Dreaming of being a superstar and celebrity since she was a little girl, Henrietta went on to become Europa's biggest star, though pop music, however she was assassinated, when tampering with her microphone electrocuted her. Some time at a later point she resurrected. The mutant team <a href=\"/x-statix/4060-11485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11485\">X-Statix</a> intervened and saved her from Europa government agents who wished her to stay dead. After joining the X-Statix team, she apparently died two more times before remaining dead. After her death, her record label put out a song Back from the Dead, that killed anyone who sang it aloud. The X-Statix member <a href=\"/el-guapo/4005-43412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43412\">El Guapo</a> was killed this way, impaled on his very own skateboard. To test the theory of the song, the X-Statix had Dead Girl, who is already dead, sing the song aloud. When she did, she was instantly destroyed proving the theory true. While she was reforming, she saw the corpse of Henrietta Hunter. When <a href=\"/dead-girl/4005-11483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11483\">Dead Girl</a> asked Henrietta about the song, she responded, saying that the song was her own way of getting revenge on those who wanted her dead. X-Statix arranged for the President of Europa to sing the song, allowing Henrietta to get her true revenge.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Henrietta Hunter is a <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel comics</a> character, and she was created by writer <a href=\"/peter-milligan/4040-41484/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41484\">Peter Milligan</a> and artist <a href=\"/michael-mike-allred/4040-16768/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-16768\">Mike Allred</a> and she first appeared in <a href=\"/x-statix/4050-9478/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9478\">X-Statix #13</a> released in 2003. The character who became Henrietta Hunter was originallty intended to be the late <a href=\"/lady-diana-spencer/4005-59653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59653\">Princess Diana</a> resurrected back from the dead. The story arc were to have been, Di Another Day. A senior editor at Marvel vetoed the idea, story information was leaked to the press and the resulting negatively publicity also a factor in the writers to quickly change her to a new character, a pop diva from the fictional nation of \"Europa\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Henrietta Hunter still bares an uncanny resemblance to the late Princess of Wales, save that her hair color and style has been changed and her name and reasons for celebrity within the narrative have changed.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><strong>Note:</strong> Originally, Henrietta Hunter was supposed to be the revived British princess Diana, but due to much criticism (even from the Royal family itself), Marvel changed the character to a fictional character instead.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>A mutant, Henrietta Hunter possessed the power of empathy. She was adept at sensing and reading the feelings and emotions of others. After her first resurrection, Henrietta seemed to have the ability to sense and communicate with the dead or spirits. Through unknown means, anyone who would sing her song, the single Back From the Dead, aloud would die.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><ul><li>Height: 5'10\"</li><li>Weight: 130 lbs</li><li>Hair: Black</li><li>Eyes: Green</li></ul>",

    "deck": "Paul Destine became Destiny when he wore the Helmet of Power which was actually the disguised Serpent Crown. He would clash with Namor on numerous occassions until his death during their final battle.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Early in the twentieth century, Paul Destine used the stage name Mentallo and earned a living reading minds as a sideshow act. He wanted to learn more about his powers and did research on a number of books on magic. He learned of a legendary race called the Ancients that mastered telepathy. Destine joined an expedition headed to Antarctica hoping to find the Ancient's civilization. His party found an advanced form of dynamo encased in ice which had been built by the Ancients and Destine wanted the dynamo to increase his telepathic powers. Destine accidently triggered an avalanche and was gravely injured. Destine revived to find the Helmet of Power close by as it apparently was hurledÂ near his body during the avalanche. Destine placed the Helmet of Power on his head and was healed from his injuries. The Helmet also increased his psionic abilities and transformed his body into a larger, physically stronger man. Destine then used one of the Ancient's devices to place himself in suspended animation and allow his powers to increase. <br /></p> <h2>Character Creation</h2> <p>Paul Destine was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\" href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\">Roy Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3800\" href=\"/john-buscema/4040-3800/\">John Buscema</a>.</p> <h2>Character Evolution</h2> <p>Decades later, Destine emerged from suspended animation and called himself Destiny because he believed it was his fate to rule the world. He learned the existence of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\" href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\">Atlantean</a> civilization beneath the Antarctic ice. Destiny then triggered a series of earthquakes that threatened the Atlantean kingdom. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\" href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\">Namor</a> went to the surface to investigate and confronted Destiny. Destiny psionically held Namor helpless and used his powers to destroy the Atlantean settlement. Most of the population survived but the Atlantean emperor Thakorr and the princess Fen were killed in the catastrophe. Destiny then gave Namor amnesia and forced him to fly to New York. Namor would spend years living as a derelict, unaware of his true identityÂ until it was restored through the actions of the Human Torch. Destiny would place himself in suspended animation once again to increase his powers further.Â <br /><br />DestinyÂ emerged from suspended animation and clashed with Namor in Antarctica.Â During the battle, NamorÂ unintentionally triggered an avalanche and was buried under the ice. Namor freed himself from the ice but Destiny had fled. Destiny made his way back to the United States and became a third party presidential candidate under his true name. He planned to take mental control of everyone who heard his speeches and help him win the election. He would then use the United States military might to conquer the planet once he became President. Destiny planned to enslave a large portion of the population mentally through a live television address. His plan was thwarted when Namor bursted through the television studio and the two engaged in battle. Namor was hurled off the roof of the building to the streets below. Namor survived the impact due to his superhuman strength and this drove Destiny insane. Irrationally claiming he did not need the Helmet, Destiny said he would levitate himself down to the cheering masses of his followers. Destiny jumped off the building and fell to his death. <br /><br /><b>Powers and Abilities: <br /></b>Paul Destine had some telepathic abilities and could read the minds of people withinÂ his close vicinity. When he wore the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\" href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\">Helmet of Power</a>Â then he gained vast superhuman abilities. The Helmet increased his telepathic abilities, provided him superhuman strength and durability and could read minds from a longer range. He also could project visions into the mind of others andÂ place people under his mental domination.Â He could levitate, fire powerful blasts of psionic energy and perform feats of telekinesis.Â Â <br /><br /><b>Weapons:<br /></b>Destiny derived most of his powers from the Helmet of Power which was actually the disguised Serpent Crown.</p>",

In Menzoberranzan, as with all drow cities, every drow (dark elf) family is ranked according to House in the favor of the deity. The great Houses constantly plot against one another, planning and carrying out the downfall of rivals so that they might ascend in city's hierarchy, and in the eyes of Lolth. Though a goddess of chaos, Lolth has placed strict requirements for advancement upon her people, knowing that too much chaos would utterly destroy her most faithful worshipers</p><p>Amid all the planning and scheming is <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52082\" href=\"/house-dourden/4060-52082/\" slug=\"house-dourden\">House Do'urden</a>, the tenth house and a noble house struggling its way up the ladder of Menzoberranzan's power structure. Lolth's statutes decree that one house may attack another, but the destruction must take place within a single night, and the rival house must be utterly destroyed. As long as the first condition is met, no other houses may interfere in the war. The second condition must be met, for if any member of the besieged family lives to the next morning, they may demand retribution from the city's Ruling Council.

Gaining this confirmation, Dinin returns home to the throne room of his mother who is pregnant yet again.</p><p>Matron Malice finalizes her plans against House DeVir with her husbands and children, all the while she is experiencing the pains of her impending delivery. Her child will be born this night, a third son who will not live to see the morning. A third-born son of a great House is traditionally given to Lolth in blood sacrifice, and so he will be killed as soon as he has been given a name.</p><p>House Do'urden launches its attack on DeVir, pressing every advantage it possesses, both physically in terms of warriors, and psychically in terms of prayers to Lolth. The battle is a virtual stalemate until Lolth grants the prayers of Do'urden over those of DeVir, allowing the psychic defenses of the rival house to fall. In the middle of the carnage can be found <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43488\" href=\"/zaknafein/4005-43488/\" slug=\"zaknafein\">Zaknafein</a>, Weapons Master and First Husband of House Do'urden. Zak is the finest swordsman in Menzoberranzan, possibly the best that has ever lived in all of Faerun. He cuts a swath through the DeVir warriors and enters the chapel of House DeVir and slays Matron Ginafae and all her daughters.</p><p>Back in the Do'urden chapel, Malice is in the throes of birth pangs, and she delivers her third son, naming him Drizzt. In the hallways of House DeVir, the newborn babe's older brothers complete the slaughter of the DeVir family. When the fighting has subsided, Dinin catches his older brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43485\" href=\"/nalfein-dourden/4005-43485/\" slug=\"nalfein-dourden\">Nalfein Do'urden</a> by surprise and stabs him in the back through the heart, taking the position of elderboy in the House. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43484\" href=\"/maya-dourden/4005-43484/\" slug=\"maya-dourden\">Maya Do'urden</a>, youngest sister of House Do'urden, senses the death, and stays the hand of her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43483\" href=\"/briza-dourden/4005-43483/\" slug=\"briza-dourden\">Briza Do'urden</a> just as she is about to strike the sacrificial blow. They deem the spider goddess appeased by the death of Nalfein, and Malice spares the baby. For the first time, they notice Drizzt was born with purple eyes, an extreme rarity among his usually red-eyed species. At DeVir, the Do'urden warriors search the House, finding and killing every remaining member of the fallen family so as to leave no witnesses behind. Zak finds three little children, and he hates himself for what his culture is forcing him to do, and for his lack of courage to stand up to the wrongness of it all.</p><p>In Sorcere, Alton DeVir arrives at the chambers of the Faceless One, and is immediately attacked. He runs, but cannot get away from the more powerful wizard, and is near his end. Just before the killing blow, the Faceless One informs Alton that he is the last of his family, his house has fallen. Raising his hand to complete his end of the deal, the Faceless One is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel through the back of his neck. He has been killed by his own brother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43481\" href=\"/masoj-hunett/4005-43481/\" slug=\"masoj-hunett\">Masoj Hun'ett</a>, in revenge for years of subservience to the Faceless One. Masoj has spared Alton, concocting a plan to allow the final member of the DeVir family to take the place of the Faceless One, and eventually enact his revenge on Do'urden. In return, Masoj will no longer be subservient, and immediately gains access to a myriad of powerful magical items, the most desirable of which is a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43495\" href=\"/guenhwyvars-figurine/4055-43495/\" slug=\"guenhwyvars-figurine\">Guenhwyvar's Figurine</a> of a black panther.</p><h3>House Do'urden: Growing Up Drow</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43487\" href=\"/vierna-dourden/4005-43487/\" slug=\"vierna-dourden\">Vierna Do'urden</a>, Drizzt's second sister, is given the charge of rearing the boy, a process in drow society that is <strong><em>\"not a time of nuturing, but of indoctrination.\"</em></strong> As with all males, Drizzt is treated as a second, or even third-class citizen, subservient to females in every way, most especially to the priestesses of Lolth. She strives to train Drizzt in the ways of the drow, honing the skills that set their race apart. He struggles to use his faerie fire, globes of darkness, and levitation correctly. His sister Briza castigates Vierna for being soft and compassionate to the boy, leading his treatment to nearly instantly become harsh, suffering the end of Vierna's whip. Though it all, Drizzt holds onto his joyful spirit and innocence. At the age of sixteen, Drizzt stands before his mother and is proclaimed to be \"secondboy\" of House Do'urden. Malice warns him, <strong><em>\"Dishonor me, and I will put needles into your purple eyes.\"</em></strong> As with all drow females, Malice would not hesitate to do just that. He meets Zaknafein as an equal for the first time, and being both his father and House Weapons Master, he tests the boy's skill and agility. Malice believes because of his intelligence and digital dexterity he should enter the school for wizards, Sorcere. Zak does not agree, and challenges Drizzt to juggle coins with two hands, something he easily accomplishes. Not convinced, Malice prods Zak to push the lad further, so he throws ten coins through the air, telling Drizzt, <strong><em>\"Catch them all or you will land in Sorcere, the school of magic. That is not where you belong!\"</em></strong> Again, the feat is no difficult thing for the drow youth.</p><p>Rather than being sent directly to Melee-Magthere, Drizzt is entrusted to Zak for his weapons training. He is taken to spartan quarters, and instructed that all his time, whether eating, sleeping, or training will be spent in that single room. Other than a bed, weapons and a training dummy, the room is broad and empty. Zak leaves him to investigate the armaments, judging which best suit his hands. Zak, for his part, returns to his own quarters haunted by the faces of the children he has been forced to kill, and wonders if his own son's soul will become dark and tainted like every other drow in the Underdark.</p><p>Across the city in Sorcere, the new Faceless One, Alton DeVir attempts an ill-advised spell which allows him to break the barrier between life and death and contact his deceased mother. He wishes to know what House it was that caused his own's downfall, but is interrupted by a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43492\" href=\"/yolchol/4015-43492/\" slug=\"yolchol\">Yolchol</a> just before she can reveal the truth. He is warned by the grotesque handmaiden of Lolth that the Spider Queen has little patience or mercy for meddling males. The wizard is explosively punished for his defiance, much to the chagrin of Masoj.</p><p>Drizzt's training with Zak commences, and continues in urgency. One day while sparring, Zaknafein inadvertently reveals that Drizzt had once had two brothers, and explains the true nature of the older brother's death. Drizzt is shocked to learn that Nalfein died on the night of his birth, not from the axe of a dwarf or the pick of a gnome, but the blade of a drow warrior. (Zak does not reveal at this time that it was his other brother, Dinin, that did the nefarious deed.) Drizzt becomes absorbed in his training for three more years, spending nearly every waking moment with Zaknafein, honing his already considerable skills.</p><p>Matron Malice comes to call at Drizzt's quarters when he turns nineteen to inspect his progress in warrior's training. Zaknafein challenges him immediately, drawing first blood as they seek to impress the matron. At first it seems that Drizzt gains the upper hand, but Zak easily turns his sword thrust against him and bloodies him a second time. Malice, however, is pleased that he even held his own against the weapons master, and proclaims him ready for Melee-Magthere.</p><p>At Sorcere, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43486\" href=\"/sinafey-hunett/4005-43486/\" slug=\"sinafey-hunett\">Sinafey Hun'ett</a> comes to call upon her son Gelroos Hun'ett, the man otherwise known as the Faceless One. She quickly discovers Alton has taken his place, but just as quickly is informed by her younger son Masoj that he was the one who took his older brother's life. In typical drow fashion, Sinafey is not alarmed by the news, and in fact seems pleased. She immediately accepts Alton in place of her son to be her eyes and ears within Sorcere. When he begs to know who it was that brought about the downfall of his House from Sinafey, she eventually relents and gives him a name: Do'urden.</p><p>Next, Drizzt gathers with the members of the other noble Houses to bear witness to the punishment of a failed attack. House Teken'duis attacked House Freth and failed, leaving three noble children alive to make accusation. Matron Baenre brings all of the power that is hers to command, both magical and political, and brings down House Teken'duis. Every last member of the family and all the servants are put to death and the house torn apart and burned to the ground. Drizzt is appalled by what passes for drow justice, and his eyes are opened a little more to what his people are truly like.</p><p>Drizzt's revulsion at the punishment does not go unnoticed by his mother and sisters. They deem his heart too soft for their designs, and believe he must be made to take the life of another drow. Covering a servant goblin in the glamour of a drow warrior. They approach Drizzt with a ruse, his sister Maya claiming right of challenge against her little brother. The goblin poses as her champion, and attacks Drizzt. The sparring match lasts mere seconds, Drizzt disarming the false drow with his initial strike. As the goblin lays on the floor at the mercy of his blade, his mother and sisters insist he finish off the challenger. Following the command of his mother, he sends his blade home, but looks away as he does so. Before she leaves, Malice says, <em>\"You are a drow warrior now. You have earned it.\"</em></p><p>In Malice's throne room, Zaknafein protests Drizzt's being sent to the Academy, saying the instructors there will ruin him. Secretly, he knows they will further attempt to indoctrinate the boy into the philosophy of the drow, making him a cold-blooded murderer. Zak begs for two more years to mold him into the finest swordsman in all of Menzoberranzan, for his skills already surpass those of half of the Academy's student body. Malice insists that he must attend, because there is more to being a drow warrior than weapons mastery. Zak insists that Drizzt will only be taught treachery and deceit, tools which Malice believes will do the young one well and make him strong. Zak is warned to further keep his blasphemy to himself and not to interfere further in the life of their son, otherwise she will offer up Zak's heart as a sacrifice to the Spider Queen.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/111629-68362-maya-do-urden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-111629\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5842696629213\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/111629-68362-maya-do-urden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-111629\"><img alt=\"Maya Do'urden\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/111629-68362-maya-do-urden.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/111629-68362-maya-do-urden.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></a><figcaption>Maya Do'urden</figcaption></figure><p>In his anger and determination to never allow Drizzt to become what he fears, Zak marches directly to his son's room and begins attacking him. He confronts the boy with his recent killing, challenging him to see if any remorse remains in Drizzt's soul. During the battle, Zak looses himself in his own memories, telegraphing the guilt and pain he feels for his own sins onto Drizzt. This laspe of attention allows him to give himself over to his rage, and Drizzt takes advantage, but not before Zak plays dirty and blinds his boy to regain the upper hand. When Drizzt asks, <strong><em>\"Do you so hate to lose?\",</em></strong> Zak's response is <strong><em>\"Do you not understand? To lose is to die!\"</em></strong> In the end, Zak sees that Drizzt is still truly an innocent, and fears for him all the more, knowing he will not learn of the treachery around him until it is possibly too late. He walks away, telling Drizzt to <strong><em>\"go and learn who you truly are.\"</em></strong> Drizzt dons his full armor for the first time, and is escorted by his brother (and instructor) Dinin to Melee-Magthere.</p><h3>The Academy: The Heart of the Drow</h3><p>Drizzt enters The Academy's warrior school, Melee-Magthere. Among the first year students is a young drow of the fifteenth house named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43479\" href=\"/kelnozz-kenafen/4005-43479/\" slug=\"kelnozz-kenafen\">Kelnozz Kenafen</a>. Unknown to the them both, the new acquaintance would serve to be a lasting reminder of the nature of drowkind. As the first year students gather in the pyramid-shaped school, they are introduced to Hatch'net, the Master of Lore. Hatch'net imparts the drow version of the history of the world and their people's place in it:</p><blockquote>\"Menzoberranzan was not always our home, nor was any other cavern of the Underdark. Once we walked the surface of the world. Do you know of the surface? An awful place. Each day a great ball of fire rises into the open skies above...bringing hours of a light greater than the punishing spells of the priestesses of Lolth! Once our people walked the surface of the world...we walked beside the pale-skinned elves, the faeries! We thought the faeries our friends, we called them kin! We could not know, in our innocence, that they were the embodiment of deceit and evil!<p>We could not know that they would turn on us so suddenlyâslaughtering our children and the eldest of our race. Without mercy the evil faeries pursued us across the surface of the world. Always we asked for peace, and always we were answered by swords and killing arrows. Then we found the goddess. It was the Spider Queen who took our orphaned race to her side and helped us fight off our enemies. It was Lolth who guided us to the paradise of the Underdark. And it is she who now gives us the strength and the magic to pay back our enemies.</p><p>You are the drow! Never again to be downtrodden, rulers of all you desire, conquerors of lands you choose to inhabit!\"</p></blockquote><p>Hatch'net's tirade went on and on, disparaging every other race that stood for goodness, or considered the drow a natural enemy. Light elves, deep gnomes, duergar dwarves, any intelligent surface creature, or any one who worshiped ought but Lolth were all labeled evil and therefore worthy of destruction. Thus began the indoctrination of the drow youth, but Drizzt was only left further appalled.</p><p>In the beginning days of the training, the students are introduced to the Grand Melee. The Grand Melee is essentially a free for all involving all students of the same year. The only rule in the Grand Melee is that <strong><em>\"if a master calls you out, then you are out.\"</em></strong> Otherwise, anything and everything is acceptable, a factor which Drizzt would soon learn firsthand.</p><p>Kelnozz convinces Drizzt to form a team to better take on the other students. When Drizzt reminds him that in the end there can be only one <em>(yes, I said it)</em>, Kelnozz replies, <strong><em>\"let us defeat the others and then we can decide the matter between ourselves.\"</em></strong> Drizzt agrees, and the pair cut a swath through the singular warriors roaming the vast Grand Melee cavern. Drizzt is clearly the dominant fighter of the pair, impressing even Hatch'net and the other instructors. Near the end of the melee, Kelnozz is trapped and about to take a \"killing\" blow. Drizzt rushes in to save his partner, only to find himself struck in the back of the head by that same partner. Kelnozz wins the Grand Melee through treachery rather than skill, a lesson Drizzt would not soon forget.</p><p>While Masoj shares plans with Alton about Sinafey's designs for the downfall of House Do'urden, Drizzt is subjected to more and more of the hysterical ravings of Hatch'net. Drizzt remarks to himself that, though he is constantly barraged with so-called evidence of the evil and treacherous \"lesser races,\" the only deceit he has ever actually witnessed (or been the recipient of) has been that of his own people. He bore the psychological training so that he could get to the physical. At this he excelled, quickly and easily surpassing his comrades.</p><p>When it came time for the second Grand Melee, Drizzt's skills were so finely honed, that none could match him, and the lessons he had learned of treachery he never forgot again. Where his peers would use lies and mistrust to advance themselves, Drizzt used logic and misdirection in addition to his superior skill, winning the day and taking first in the Grand Melee. Drizzt placed his trust in the only stable thing in his life, his skill and his scimitars, never again letting anyone under his guard again for many, many years. He practiced every waking hour, well beyond the requirements of the Melee-Magthere instructors. His work pays great dividend, winning him the Grand Melee for the next two years. His teachers are so impressed they move him up in the next Grand Melee with student three years ahead of him in their training, and he still wins nearly effortlessly.</p><p>By his eighth year, Drizzt is assigned to one of the groups doing practice patrols in the Underdark surrounding Menzoberranzan. In one such assignment, his party is told that a noble child of the First House, a Baenre, has gone missing in the tunnels, and that a group of hook horrors has been spotted. Without warning or instruction from his masters, Drizzt races off into the tunnels alone to effect a rescue. He finds the child crying and surrounded by three of the terrible beasts, and quickly dispatches one of them, but just as quickly looses the element of surprise. Creatures of the Underdark, hook horrors are giant creatures with bird-like beaks, humongous clawed arms, and thick carapaces. Quite mindless, they will attack and eat anything, including a drow child or a fierce warrior.</p><p>Before Drizzt can gain ground on another of the beasts, it has the child within its clawed arms, and tears the poor girl to shreds. He is attacked by the beast, but is able to drive his scimitars through its heart before it can snap his head off. Meanwhile, the rest of his party \"discovers\" that the child was no noble drow, but just a wandering orphan or castoff of low house, and therefore meaningless to them. Drizzt, for his part, believes the whole event to have been staged, and is greatly angered by the senseless and useless loss of life. He confronts Dinin, who is one of his instructors, and is told to remember his place. As he begins to protest further, they are interrupted by their sister, Vierna. She has come to warn them to be on their guard, for there are rumors of vengeance against House Do'urden, but from quarters unknown. Presumably, the revenge would be enacted in response to the fall of House DeVir from so many years before.</p><p>This is the first that Drizzt has heard of DeVir, and ask who they are. Dinin answers <strong><em>\"House DeVir. On the very night you were born, they ceased to exist. An excellent attack, thank you.\"</em></strong> Drizzt is appalled that his family was responsible for the murder of an entire family, and is warned by Vierna, <strong><em>\"Watch your words secondboy, the deed was perfectly executed. In the eyes of Menzoberranzan it never happened.\"</em></strong> Drizzt also learns that not only was Zaknafein involved in the attack, but that it was his duty to slay the matron and priestesses of DeVir, along with any other children who might have been in hiding. Drizzt is further informed that, as the third-born son of the house, he was to have been sacrificed to Lolth as tradition demanded, but for the blade of Dinin through Nalfein's heart. Vierna tells Drizzt, <strong><em>\"You should thank him for that kindness.\"</em></strong> Dinin and Vierna leave Drizzt alone in his remorse.</p><p>For Drizzt's final year at the Academy, he and every other student are assigned a year in the other two divisions of the school, sixth months in Sorcere, and six in Arach-Tinith. The idea is to give the warriors exposure to the other disciplines so that they can better function in their necessary societal role. Unbeknown to Drizzt, he has stumbled into the clutches of one of his mortal enemies, a man he has never met before, Masoj Hun'ett. Masoj proves to be a braggadocio (as all drow wizards are), but found that his time in Sorcere was the most enjoyable of all his years at the Academy. He found that he was quite adept at the discipline, dexterity, and intellectual acrobatics necessary to perform magic, and within a few short week was already surpassing some of the most promising wizard acolytes. If his mother has not been convinced he would be a better warrior and had been sent to Sorcere instead, Drizzt might have become a master mage.</p><p>Drizzt spent his time mastering every cantrip and spell assigned, and thoroughly enjoyed being shown magical artifacts and weapons. Masoj grew more and more jealous and hateful of Drizzt because how easy all this seemed to the warrior. Many times he saw opportunity to eliminate the boy, but the orders of his matron stayed his hand. He had no desire to incur her wrath. Near the end of his time in Sorcere, Drizzt is introduced to Masoj's master, the Faceless One. Alton DeVir, still hot for vengeance, ignores the commands of Sinafey Hun'ett and attacks Drizzt in his office. He might have succeeded in killing the warrior if not for the intervention of Masoj. Alton is pounced upon by a great black panter, a beast that Masoj calls his pet, summonded from the astral plane via an onyx figurine. Drizzt is immediately enamored by the majesty and beauty of the animal, for he has met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43476\" href=\"/guenhwyvar/4005-43476/\" slug=\"guenhwyvar\">Guenhwyvar</a> for the first time. It would not be their final meeting.</p><p>His six months in Sorcere over, Drizzt makes his way into Arach-Tinith and spends his last months of training among the priestesses of Lolth. As enjoyable his time in Sorcere had been, his time in Arach-Tinith was full of ten times the drudgery. Forced to listen to sermon after sermon of the glory and wisdom and goodness and power of the Spider Queen, Drizzt came to regard the dark goddesses worshipers more like slaves. He suffers it all until graduation day, where he and all the other male warriors who are graduating are offered one of the things that is most denied them, the bodies of the priestesses of Lolth. To graduate, the warriors and priestesses are to pair off and procreate as an act of worship to Lolth. Drizzt, when he is approached by one of the beautiful priestesses, is able to throw off his drug induced stupor and refuse her advances. He flees into the surrounding tunnels.</p><p>Vierna, in white-hot anger, tracks him down and confronts him. <strong><em>\"You refused a high priestess,\"</em></strong> she screams at him. <strong><em>\"By the laws, she could kill you for your insolence.\"</em></strong> When Drizzt says that he could not because he does not care for her, she grows even more angry and tells him it is not about caring, but about power gained from pleasing the Spider Queen. She orders him to return to the ceremony, but he refuses. She then takes him to another place, a high road overlooking a chasm. In the chasm are <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43490\" href=\"/drider/4015-43490/\" slug=\"drider\">Drider</a>, mindless creatures, drow from the waist up, spider from the waist down. They are created as a punishment for males who disobey, the power granted by Lolth changing a rebellious male into one of those evil creatures. Vierna knocks Drizzt down into the chasm, leaving him as food for the driders.</p><h3>House Do'urden: Tidings of War</h3><p>Miraculously, Drizzt awakens in a bed a while later, his mother standing over him. She has saved him for her own designs, and will no longer tolerate his \"blasphemy\" of Lolth any longer. What Vierna meant as mercy, leaving him to die as a meal for the driders, will not be done to him again. If Malice hears him ever disparage the Spider Goddess again, she will take him back to that place, not to kill him, but to turn him into a drider himself. Drizzt returns to Melee-Magthere, and graduates with the highest honors in his class. He returns home and acts like the subservient secondboy they expect him to be, but Zaknafein, hiding in the shadows, hears his son and believes that he has truly been turned to Lolth's side.</p><p>Zak believes he has failed his son, and that he should have just killed the boy so that he would not have become corrupt. Drizzt fears to face Zak again, now believing his mentor little more than a cold-blooded killer after hearing of his exploits on the night of his birth. Most confusing to Drizzt though, was the fact that he knew his mother and sisters for exactly what they were, but Zaknafein now seemed to be false, saying things to Drizzt and training him to be something that he himself was not.</p><p>Malice gathers he entire household together and proclaims to them the truth to the rumors of war against them. They still do not know who it could be, for none of the the houses below them could possibly contest their power, and even very few of those above them could either. Matron Malice welcomes the coming battle, telling her house to prepare for any and every attack, and when that attack comes, they would rise victorious. Once triumphant, Malice would take her place among the eight matrons on the Ruling Council as matron of the eighth house of Menzoberranzan.</p><p>Two days later, Drizzt joins one of the official patrol groups that kept the caverns safe around Menzoberranzan. In his group was his brother Dinin, Masoj Hun'ett, and a brand new friend, the beautiful astral panther Guenhwyvar. Many times the pair fought shoulder to shoulder as friends and comrades, much to the chagrin and hatred of Masoj who takes it upon himself to castigate the great cat harshly. Masoj grows worried and hopes that Sinafey will call for his death soon.</p><p>Sinafey does make a move, but not the exact one that Masoj was wishing for. She calls the ruling council of the city together, and calls for the punishment of House Do'urden for a failed attack. She reveals that Alton DeVir has survived, and has been posing as her son the Faceless One for all these years. Matron Baenre states that the council cannot enact punishment for a crime so long past, but Sinafey argues that they need not undertake punishment, but rather turn a blind eye as vengeance is taken. Baenre concurs and adjourns the meeting by saying, <strong><em>\"This matter is settled, my sisters. It is good that we never met this day.\"</em></strong> Sinafey puts her plan in motion.</p><p>Dinin announces to his patrol group that they have been chosen for a rare opportunity, a surface raid. There are to travel for many days through the Underdark to the surface, and there raid a group of faeries, or light skinned elves, their mortal enemies. As they depart, Drizzt asks where Masoj and Guenhwyvar are, and he is told that wizards are not allowed on the surface by law, and so the panther will stay behind as well. Approaching the surface, Drizzt feels the breeze for the first time, and when they break into the night sky, he sees the cool radiance of the moon and is drawn to it like nothing else ever before. Within site of the cave opening was a gathering of faeries partaking in a revel to some moon goddess or other. Dinin calls for the attack while Drizzt whispers to himself,</p><h3><em>\"Such creatures as these are notâcannot be evil.\"</em></h3><p>Drizzt stands back in horror as he watches his dark kind, in heart not in skin, as they coldly cut down these bright and shining people who were only moments before dancing and laughing. One of the victims reaches out to him, begging for mercy and help just before she is cut down from behind. When the woman's daughter rushes to the her fallen mother, Drizzt swipes his sword across her, knocking her to the ground. He has not hurt her, however, and whispers to her to stay down. He lies to Dinin and proclaims her dead, causing Dinin to proclaim,</p><h3><em>\"Finally you have learned what it is to be a drow warrior!\"</em></h3><p>They leave the terrified and crying elf child behind. Drizzt's only consolation is that she will live to see another day.</p><p>The drow make their way back toward the cave as the sun begins to rise. The priestess leading them orders them to hurry, for</p><h3><em>\"the great ball of fire rises.\"</em></h3><p>As the sun crests the mountain peaks, Drizzt's comrades duck and run for cover, but he himself turns and stands his ground. When he sees the sun for the first time, he does something a drow has rarely done in all of history apart from treachery and deceit. Drizzt Do'urden smiled in joy.</p><h3>The Underdark: Danger in Every Shadow</h3><p>Sinafey Hun'ett learns from the lower planes that House Do'urden has lost the favor of Lolth. She does not know the details, but there is something one of the sons has done to displease the goddess, thereby giving House Hun'ett opportunity to crush the upstart Do'urdens. Though Hun'ett is higher in the hierarchy than Do'urden, Sinafey knows that Malice has been ascending in the stature of Menzoberranzan's society, and would one day soon attack the upper Houses. If Malice were to regain Lolth's blessings, then Hun'ett would be doomed. Sinafey tells her son, Masoj that <strong><em>\"Drizzt Do'urden must die within ten days.\"</em></strong></p><p>Drizzt sees Zak after he returns from the surface, and though his father is pleasant to him, Drizzt gives him something of the cold shoulder. They agree to meet one another in the gym in a week after Drizzt returns from another patrol of the surrounding Underdark. Going their own ways, both are still determined that the other must die. Drizzt still believes his father a cold-blooded murderer, and Zak believes that Drizzt is on his way to becoming the same.</p><p>Drizzt's next patrol takes them just five miles outside of the city, where they encounter a crew of Svirfnebli, deep gnomes on a mining expedition. Drow and deep gnomes were mortal enemies, and such an encounter could only end in bloodshed. Drizzt tries to dissuade Dinin from attacking, even to the point of suggesting parley, but his rebuked in typical drow fashion. Dinin orders the attack, commanding them to go after the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a> first, stating, <strong><em>\"He is the key to their strength with the stone.\"</em></strong> The rush into the gnomes, taking down the non-working scouts first, then heading for the crew leader. The drow are outnumbered, but ruthless, giving out much more damage than they took. This prompts the leader to grab a jewel and slam it to the ground, creating an earth elemental and commanding it to attack the drow. Drizzt races to the attack, but is struck down. Guenhwyvar, against his master's wishes, rushes in to defend Drizzt and is gravely injured, but buys him the time he needs to recover. As Drizzt climbs up to the creatures head and is about to strike a killing blow, Masoj sends a bolt of lightning into them, hoping to kill both the elemental and Drizzt, making it appear to be an accident. Masoj is then clubbed in the back of the head by the gnome leader, who then moves on Drizzt. Drizzt tells him to go ahead and torture him, but the gnome tells him that is not their way. They capture the gnome, and Dinin orders him killed. As the priestess moves forward to torture the gnome, Drizzt convinces them to allow him to live and go back home to tell the other Svirfnebli of the superiority of drow strength. Dinin likes the idea, but not before the take the gnome leader's hands first. Dinin says, <strong><em>\"I want to hear his screams.\"</em></strong></p><p>Back in Menzoberranzan, two separate matrons are having problems of their own. Malice communes with a yolchol to learn the whims of Lolth, and discovers that there is indeed a plot against her house. When she asks for the name of the house that conspires against them, the yolchol says that Lolth will not answer a question to which the answer is already known. Leaving Malice in a concussive flash, the yolchol has now caused confusion and anger in Malice. Who knows the answer. Across the city, Sinafey is punishing Masoj for his failure to kill Drizzt. The ten days Lolth allowed are nearly gone, and so Masoj begs for another chance. The matron agrees, but he is forced to take the somewhat inept Alton DeVir along with him. Malice gathers he household, and puts the males under the whip trying to get an answer to their riddle. As Dinin is being lashed, Drizzt recalls the treacherous attack of Masoj during the battle with the earth elemental, and informs Malice of the deed. Now they know for certain the identity of House that plots against them, House Hun'ett. Malice calls upon the yolchol again to learn the standing of Hun'ett with Lolth. This time the yolchol is belligerent, saying that the deed of wiping out the gnomes does not offset the Spider Queen's displeasure. When Malice asks why Lolth is displeased with her house, she is again told there will not be a reply to a question whose answer is already know. Malice is left angry and confused once again. She and her daughters set out to discover who in their family has betrayed Lolth, but they already have a chief suspect in mind.</p><p>In the gymnasium, Zak and Drizzt have their agreed upon workout session. Zak begins to mock Drizzt and attacks him mercilessly. This is no workout session, and his plan to kill Zak has now been turned back on him. He finds himself struggling to defend against his former mentor. Zak draws first blood, and calls him murderer after referencing the elven child he had \"killed\" on the surface. Finally, Drizzt has had enough and his outrage allows him to regain his footing and gain the upper hand on Zak. Drizzt throws the accusations back in Zak's face, to which Zaknafein declares he must kill if he is to be allowed to remain alive by Malice. When Zak presses the attack again, Drizzt quells it by stating did not kill the child, but faked it for the benefit of Dinin. Drizzt tells Zak,</p><h3><em>\"I killed no elves that day. The only ones I desired to kill were my own companions.\"</em></h3><p>Unknown to the two warriors, Matron Malice is looking over their shoulder through a scrying pool, and hears the entire conversation. In tears, Zak reveals to him that he is Drizzt's father, and is thankful that his soul remains intact. He warns Drizzt that he will one day have to kill drow just as his father had, but Drizzt vows he will never kill another drow. Either way, they both realize that they are no longer alone in the horrible place they are forced to call home.</p><p>Malice orders her entire household to stay within the walls of the home, an order which Drizzt promptly disobeys. Masoj puts his second chance plan into motion, calling on Guenhwyvar and setting her to track down and kill Drizzt. Guenhwyvar tries to resist the order, but the magic of the figurine compels her to obey, no matter her own wishes. Out in the wild of the Underdark, Drizzt is so wrapped up in his own thoughts and concerns that he is caught unawares by a cave fisher. The beast lashes Drizzt around the neck with its proboscis and begins to draw him up when Guenhwyvar appears out of the shadows and rescues him. The two of them take the monster down together, but then Guen immediately turns on him. Drizzt realizes that she has been sent to kill and prompts her to fight the unwanted urge to obey. Soon, Guen breaks the programming, and her lifelong friendship is assured. Drizzt get Guen to lead him to Masoj.</p><p>Malice summons Zak and tells him of her knowledge of their conversation, and that she plans to have Drizzt killed for sparing the elf. Zak tells her she would not dare to do it since they are about to go to war with Hun'ett, but Malice says that appeasing the Spider Queen is of higher importance. Zak literally gets down on his hands and knees and begs Malice to take him instead. She accepts, but warns him not to disrupt the ceremony that will mark his own death, otherwise she will kill him and have Drizzt tortured and killed as well. Zak responds, <strong><em>\"I have offered myself, Malice. Have your fun while you may. In the end, Zaknafein will be at peaceâMatron Malice will ever be at war!\"</em></strong></p><p>Zak is tied down the spider-shaped sacrificial altar and Malice dons her ceremonial spider-embroidered garb. Ask Malice raises the knife to strike a killing blow, Zak is calm and at peace. His final words are</p><h3><em>\"Beat them all my son. Do more than survive, as I have survived. Live! Be true to the callings of your heart!\"</em></h3><p>Malice plunges the knife home.</p><p>Near Sorcere, Masoj Hun'ett waits for the return of Guenhwyvar, and is enraged to see Drizzt coming up behind her, hale and healthy. As Drizzt is castigating Masoj over Guen's freedom of will, Alton DeVir appears and cries out for vengeance against Drizzt. Drizzt tries to strike a deal with Masoj, the figurine of Guenhwyvar in exchange for the Hun'ett's life. Not knowing that Zak is already dead, Drizzt further sweetens the deal by saying he will depart House Do'urden and take Zak with him, depriving Hun'ett's enemies of their two best warriors. Masoj scoffs at the offer, believing the power of wizards to be greater than the skill of warriors.</p><p>Alton tries to hit Drizzt with a bolt of lightning from behind, but Guen puts herself in the way and absorbs the strike. Guen goes after the Faceless One, while Drizzt attacks Masoj. Though it seems at first that the pair cannot win against the wizard's trickery, neither of them give up. Both fight through burns and broken bones to see their enemy dead. Drizzt has taken a drow life, but it was in self-defense, not in murder or internecine treachery, so he is unconcerned by the deed.</p><p>Drizzt returns to House Do'urden and searches for Zak. He is met in Zak's chambers by his mother and siblings. When he asks after Zaknafein, Malice lies and says he is away on House business, and chastises him for disobeying her command to stay within the household. Malice then notices his wounds, and he informs his family of the death of Masoj Hun'ett and the Faceless One. He also reveals the true identity of the Faceless One as Alton DeVir, and the connections all become clear to the Do'urdens. As Malice begins to praise Drizzt for slaying two enemy wizards and giving them an edge in the coming House war, Drizzt asks for Zaknafein once more. Malice's answer gives him the clue that he has been killed, and Malice confirms the deed, telling him that Lolth demanded repayment for sparing the elven child. She tells Drizzt of the agreement Zak made, sacrificing himself not only to let Drizzt live, but that Drizzt would now be weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses, and yells, <strong><em>\"A true god damn you all! And damn the Spider Queen as well!\"</em></strong> He throws a flash bomb on the ground and escapes the House while they are all blinded.</p><p>In tears, Drizzt leaves Menzoberranzan behind, taking Guen, her figurine, and his memories of his father with him.</p><h2>Exile</h2><h3>The Underdark: The Hunter</h3><p>For ten long years, Drizzt lives in the wilds of the Underdark with Guenhwyvar as his only companion. Even then, he is alone for most of his waking hours, since Guen cannot stay on the material plane for more than a few hours at a time, and must return to the astral plane for food and rest. Drizzt is still racked with guilt over Zaknafein's death, feeling that his father's sacrifice is his fault. He faces the dangers of the Underdark, defeating such monsters as hook horrors, cave trolls, and <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43561\" href=\"/basilisk/4015-43561/\" slug=\"basilisk\">Basilisk</a>; living off the natural resources and striving to live in peace with the underworld's non-violent citizens. Unfortunately, he finds his self drifting away a little more each day, sometimes losing his self-awareness to a feral side of himself he calls The Hunter. The Hunter is part of what has allowed Drizzt to survive all these years, going off pure training and instinct when attacked by the creatures of the Underdark.</p><p>Drizzt has taken up residence in a large cavern that is the equivalent of an Underdark oasis. Water runs through the cavern in the form of an underground river, and * <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43563\" href=\"/rothe/4015-43563/\" slug=\"rothe\">Rothe</a>* (a type of Underdark cattle) are abundant, serving both as a food source, and an early warning of invaders. The cavern is fairly easy to defend, something his new neighbors on the cavern's second level greatly appreciate. The * <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43564\" href=\"/myconids/4015-43564/\" slug=\"myconids\">Myconids</a>,* a race of mute fungus-men coexist with Drizzt and live in peace with him. They do not bother him, and he repays the favor. Drizzt does his part to use his skills as a drow warrior, and his ferocity as The Hunter to defend against all invaders. Guenhwyvar is at his side as much as possible, but in those moments he is alone, the hours pass like days and weeks, and he finds himself succumbing to The Hunter a little more every time he gives in to him.</p><p>Back in Menzoberranzan, the war between House Do'urden and House Hun'ett is about to come to a head. After years of behind the scenes maneuvering, neither House in favor with Lolth over the other, Hun'ett finally chooses open warfare. Sinafey has hired <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43560\" href=\"/jarlaxle-baenre/4005-43560/\" slug=\"jarlaxle-baenre\">Jarlaxle Baenre</a> and his band of mercenaries Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle, as he usually does, has been playing both ends of the conflict for his own benefit, and so comes to see Malice and report his band's progress. Malice has also hired Bregan D'aerthe, using it as an indirect weapon against her enemies, a way to cause damage and trouble without being implicated in the plots. Jarlaxle reports that Dipree, one of the Hun'ett nobles, has been assassinated by his men. The first strike in what is about to be a very short battle has been struck.</p><p>Before Jarlaxle can exit the Do'urden household, the walls shake and they come under Hun'ett's direct attack. Malice's forces are outnumbered, and so she commissions Jarlaxle once again. When he balks, saying, <strong><em>\"Bregan D'aerthe is a secretive group. We do not engage in open warfare,\"</em></strong> Malice easily changes his mind by shouting, <strong><em>\"I will pay whatever you desire. Name your price.\"</em></strong> With a sly smileâmost likely because this was how he planned things all alongâJarlaxle walks out to the Do'urden balcony and looks down on the battle. He pulls a small tin-whistle from inside his hat (which has a pocket dimension inside it) and blows a shrill note. Down below, fully half or more of the \"Hun'ett\" soldiers respond, and turn on their fellows, giving the advantage of numbers instantly to House Do'urden. Routed, the Hun'ett army turns and flees back to the safety of its home walls. Jarlaxle slyly looks to Dinin and says, <strong><em>\"It's a dark day to be a Do'urden, and even worse to be a Hun'ett. But it's an excellent time for mercenaries don't you think?\"</em></strong></p><p>Malice travels the next morning to answer a summons to Matron Baenre, expecting to witness Sinafey's execution. Instead, she walks in to find Sinafey sitting at her council seat. Matron Baenre appears in the middle of their confrontation and explains what has happened. House Hun'ett has been entirely destroyed, save for Sinafey herself. Malice is being forced to take Sinafey on as her eldest daughter, \"Shi'nayne,\" returning from Ched Nasad. When Malice protests, Matron Baenre replies,</p><h3><em>\"Many years ago, Lolth made it clear her desires that you sit upon the ruling council, Malice. And now, with Hun'ett gone and Do'urden the eighth house of Menzoberranzan, is shall be so. But understand your dilemma: you have lost more than half of your troops, and it is well known that you still do not have the favor of the Spider Queen. How long do you think it will be until some lower house moves against you.\"</em></h3><p>By taking in Sinafey, House Do'urden gains fifty soldiers of Hun'ett that survived. Sinafey goes home with Malice, her new \"mother.\"</p><p>Now that Hun'ett is out of the way, Malice turns her attention back to her wayward son. Briza and Dinin are sent out into the tunnels of the Underdark with a contingent of Do'urden soldiers to search for Drizzt. They are magically tracking him somehow, but Drizzt discovers them on his trail and deduces that it is his House Do'urden emblem that is allowing their trace on him. Drizzt ties his emblem to Guen and sends her in the opposite direction, allowing him to sneak up behind Dinin, knock him out and draw a sword on Briza. She tells him that the war with Hun'ett is over, and lies to say that he can come home and take up the mantle of weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses and tells them to never seek him out again. This prompts Briza to draw her snake-headed whip on Drizzt, which he quickly cuts to shreds. She then draws her mace to strike, and Drizzt easily ends the battle, cleaving two fingers from her hand. With the advantage, he holds his blade to her neck, and she prods him to strike her dead. To his horror, he nearly does, but relents and levitates away from her and joins Guen in the shadows. <strong><em>\"I would have done it,\"</em></strong> he tells Guen. <strong><em>\"Despite my vow never to spill drow blood again, I would have killed her. What have I become?\"</em></strong></p><p>Drizzt puts himself on the move again, knowing he cannot live in his beloved cavern is no longer secret, no longer safe. He runs through the tunnels, into twists and turns which he had never seen before until he ran directly into his past. At the end of his last stretch was a bright light (at least bright for the Underdark), he had come upon a gnome mining expedition. Drizzt follows them for days, hanging back in the shadows, listening to them longingly. They possessed something he himself had never experienced, camaraderie. He was drawn to their voices, their laughter, their smiles, believing he might go mad and totally loose himself in The Hunter if lost track of them. Eventually, their journey ended. He had come to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43553\" href=\"/blingenstone/4020-43553/\" slug=\"blingenstone\">Blingenstone</a>, the great fortress city of the Svirfnebli.</p><p>Drizzt makes an on the spot decision, and pulls Guen's figurine from his pocket and calls her to him. He says goodbye to her, stating he can no longer live out in the Underdark alone, and turns himself in to the gnomes at the gates of Blingenstone. He knows they will most likely kill him, his people and the deep gnomes were natural enemies, and might attack him on sight. Drizzt was not afraid, the fate of death at the hands of goodly people was better than the horrible isolation of the Underdark. He kept walking toward their gates and hoped and trusted for the best.</p><p>Back in Menzoberranzan, Malice castigates Briza and Dinin for their failure to capture their renegade brother. When Maya boasts that she could capture him, Dinin scoffs in fear. <strong><em>\"Since he left Menzoberranzan,\"</em></strong> he answers, <strong><em>\"Drizzt's skills have increased ten-fold.\"</em></strong> When asked if Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe would undertake tracking down the boy, but Malice says that they have already refused <strong><em>\"not for any price.\"</em></strong> Malice reveals another way, and leads her family to the chapel, and calls on a yolchol. In order to right the wrongs caused by her son, Malice asks for zin-carla. Zin-carla is the highest honor Lolth pays to her followers, the animation of the dead under the control of a Matron Mother. Great sacrifice must be made, so Malice chooses to give her patron, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43567\" href=\"/rizzen/4005-43567/\" slug=\"rizzen\">Rizzen</a>, to the slaughter. Malice and her daughters gather around the sacrificial altar, and Shi'nayneâacting as eldest daugherâholds the ceremonial dagger. Malice takes the dagger, holds it over Rizzen, then suddenly thrusts it into Shi'nayne's heart, and the last Hun'ett passes away as a sacrifice to Lolth. The yolchol is pleased, and grants the power of zin-carla. After much meditation and prayer, the soul of Zaknafein is ripped from the afterlife, and placed into his reanimated corpse, but all free will is gone. As a test of her power over him, Malice orders her undead husband to kill Rizzen, an act which he does without hesitation, flinging a dagger into the unfortunate patron's forehead.</p><h3>Blingenstone: Guest of the Deep Gnomes</h3><p>Members of the Blingenstone city council investigate Drizzt. They are naturally suspicious of him and his reasons for being in the city. Incredulous, they cannot believe that he has not only given himself up, but also the figurine of Guenhwyvarâa very powerful magical item not to be given up lightly. All the while Drizzt sat before them in chains, the Hunter inside him railed to be free, every moment heightening the rage and hunger to be free. Drizzt remained in control, keeping his composure before these wizened souls who held his life in their hands. They believe him a spy, and though he claims to be a renegade, they do not believe him since his House not only still exists, but has risen in stature in recent days. He replies that he is <strong><em>\"rogue by choice,\"</em></strong> and that he has nowhere else to go. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43555\" href=\"/firble/4005-43555/\" slug=\"firble\">Firble</a>, the gnome king's chief counselor and head of their spy network warns, <strong><em>\"Our king will rule upon your fate, dark elf. And though I believe you and shall ask for mercy, I suspect you will be executed.\"</em></strong></p><p>As Firble and the others are making their way out of his holding cell, Drizzt recalls the burrow warden he had convinced his brother to let go all those years before. He tells the gnome that he was part of that hunting party, and that one did survive, losing his hands in the battle. Firble names the burrow warden as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a>, stating that none of the citizens of Blingenstone would ever forget that dark day. Drizzt begs for Firble to bring Belwar Dissengulp, and he is left alone in the darkness.</p><p>Some time later, the burrow warden does come to see the captive drow, exclaiming, <strong><em>\"Magga cammara it is you!\"</em></strong> Belwar remembers Drizzt as the purple eyed drow that had bested his earth elemental and convinced his hunting party to take his hands rather than his life. Drizzt hangs his head in abject sorrow for what his people had done, but Belwar wants to hear nothing of it. <strong><em>\"Bah!\"</em></strong> the honored burrow warden exclaims, <strong><em>\"Your words spared me that day, and I've not forgotten it. Besides, I have new hands now.\"</em></strong> Belwar lifts up his arms, showing Drizzt an exquisite set of stone mason's tools, a hammer and pick axe, in place of hands.</p><p>Belwar informs Drizzt that it was the decision of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43554\" href=\"/king-schnicktick/4005-43554/\" slug=\"king-schnicktick\">King Schnicktick</a> to have the drow put to death. Though the King believed that Drizzt meant no harm to the city of Blingenstone, he feared the danger of keeping a drow in the city was too great, an army from Menzoberranzan might come and attack the city, using Drizzt as an excuse to declare war. Drizzt agrees with the assessment, and is so willing to end his life that he says he will not offer any resistance. Belwar replies, <strong><em>\"No, you won't, for you'll not die this day. Ten years ago you saved my life Drizzt Do'urden. Honor demands I do the same.\"</em></strong> Belwar accepts the responsibility of having Drizzt in the city, both for the drowâs safety and that of the city at large. <strong><em>\"So I'm not to die?\"</em></strong> Drizzt asks. <strong><em>\"Not unless you bring death upon yourself,\"</em></strong> is the answer.</p><p>Drizzt is plunged into the world of the deep gnomes of Blingenstone, an experience unlike anything he had ever encountered before in his life. Belwar had not only offered hospitality to another being, he offered safety, if not companionship. A drow would never offer such things, not to a enemy, let alone even a brother, unless there was money or power to be gained. Belwar acted in kindness, and he was now surrounded by former enemies who rose no hand against him. His entire outlook was now permanently changed.</p><p>Belwar leads Drizzt to his home, where they are met by guards assigned to Belwar by the King. The King has ordered the guards to stay until the truth of Drizzt's intentions are fully known. Belwar responds in anger, <em><strong>\"Be Gone! This one is in my care and I fear him not at all!\"</strong></em> The guard gnomes depart, and Belwar leads Drizzt into his home. He asks Drizzt how long he's been alone in the Underdark, and prompts the drow to tell him his story. Drizzt does just that, of his years in the house of Malice Do'urden and the eventual murder of his father, Zaknafein. He tells of his decision to forsake his dark kind and their even darker goddess, and tells of the loneliness of the Underdark, and of the Hunter who threatened to overtake him, body and soul. His story ends finally, late in the night, with his arrival at Blingenstone.</p><p>After that night, they spoke not much at all except for passing conversation. Belwar was a quiet sort who kept to his sculpting and spoke little. Drizzt, for his part, was not yet fully comfortable with the Svirfnebli language, so did not trust himself to speak well. That didn't stop the local gnomish children from being intrigued by the dark elf, and drawing him into their daily adventures. One day, the neighborhood children are debating the existence of a basilisk. There is a huge, life-sized statue of the beast near Belwar's home, and some of the children don't believe such a fantastic monster could exist. They ask Drizzt if he knows if they exists, and he states that not only had he met one, but he fought one. In great curiosity, they drag the drow to the statue and get him to re-enact his battle with the basilisk. He begin to show them, using two wooden staves to serve as his scimitars, and he quickly looses himself in the bloodlust of the Hunter, not stopping until he has broken off the head of the statue and worn his wooden staves down to stumps.</p><p>Drizzt, in speaking with Belwar later on, confesses his worry to his new friend. During his stay in Blingenstone among the gnomes, he believed he had freed himself from the Hunter, and was deathly scared with the ease the he slipped back into the psychosis. Belwar tells him not to worry overmuch, the Hunter was who he needed to become in order to survive in the wild Underdark. He is counseled to give the matter time, time and patience, and to relax since there were no enemies in the gnome city.</p><p>Outside the high stone walls of Blingenstone, the same could not be said. The zin-carla Zaknafein is slowly and surely gaining ground on his wayward son. He had found the cavern where Drizzt had lived for so long alongside the rothe and myconids, and slaughtered them all in his rage to destroy his target. Already the gnomes of Blingenstone are on high alert after finding the results of one such massacre of goblins by the former weapons master. The tention was building greatly each day, and soon the pressure would be too much for the key players in the drama to bear up under.</p><h3>The Underdark: Back Into the Darkness</h3><p>News of the goblin slaying quickly makes it back to King Schnicktick, and he and his counselors wonder what to make of it. They know for certain the attack was carried out by one or more drow because of the cleanness of the cuts they discover on the corpses. Schnicktick wonders if there is someone after \"Belwar Dissengulp's drow,\" but Firble, at first, cautions against the line of reasoning, but then does admit they know little of Drizzt's background or why he left his home. What enemies had he made there that might have tracked him to their city. Schnicktick orders Firble to contact his spy network in Menzoberranzan and learn more about the Do'urden renegade.</p><p>Out in the Underdark's caverns, Zak is beginning to place more and more strain on Matron Malice. Unable to find his quarry, he seeks to lash out against anything and everything that moves. Malice must keep a constant mental leash on him, keeping him from killing a group of gnomes and therefore giving himself up further to the Svirfnebli. His bloodlust was rising, and he needed to find Drizzt soon, or Malice would loose all control. Keeping control on a zin-carla zombie was taxing, even for the most skilled and powerful priestess of Lolth, and the longer the zin-carla was necessary until it came to fruition, the greater the stress. Even Matron Baenre admits that only one zin-carla had lasted longer, one she herself had undertaken, and that one did not end well.</p><p>Back in Blingenstone, the King and his councilors decide that Drizzt has proven his trustworthiness, and thus return his armor and scimitars. In additions to his arms, he is reunited with Guenhwyvar for the first time in many weeks. The councilor who had been given the task of examining the figurine did not wish to part with such a powerful and useful artifact, but they realized that Guen was much more of a friend and companion to Drizzt than she was a servant. Brickers, the burrow-warden who returns Guen, tries yet another time to entice Belwar on a mining expedition. In anger, Belwar refuses, and pushes the gnome out the door. When Drizzt asks, <strong><em>\"You should go with them Belwar...or are you bound to stay here and watch over me?\"</em></strong> Belwar indicates that it has nothing to do with that issue, and certainly nothing to do with his lack of hands. He could cut rock faster than anyone with his new hands. Belwar reveals that he cannot go because the last expedition he led ended in bloodshed, and he holds himself responsible. Drizzt argues in the converse, stating that it was his people and their evil intents that caused those deaths that day. Drizzt further baits Belwar by questioning his courage, a move which makes Belwar so angry he decides to go, saying, <strong><em>\"Put on your swords, elf. If I'm to go, then so are you!\"</em></strong></p><p>Belwar, Drizzt and Guen join Brickers and his expedition. Brickers was happy to have the \"most honored burrow-warden\" along, as well as the extra blades and skill of the drow. They met no resistance on their way to the place where the mineral scout had identified as potentially owning a rich vein of ore. The scouts were correct, and the gnomes threw themselves into the work of excavation, not the least of which was Belwar who carved literal rings around the rest of the workers with his fantastic hammer and pickaxe hands. Belwar was truly happy for the first time in many, many years.</p><p>Drizzt spends his days during the expedition patrolling the surrounding caverns and tunnels with Guen, himself happy to be both free to roam, but able to return to friends and companions at the end of each day. When he ventured far from the expedition, he felt the Hunter try to rise up and overtake him, but he was stronger now, and able to push the beast back down and remain Drizzt Do'urden. Both Drizzt and Belwar returned from the expedition in great spirits, Belwar feeling he finally deserved the title of \"most honored burrow-warden,\" and Drizzt finally at ease with himself and his place in the world.</p><p>Meanwhile in the caverns near Menzoberranzan, Firble meets with his contact, the infamous Jarlaxle. Firble asks about the increase of drow activity near Blingenstone, and Jarlaxle demands his usual exhorbitant payment, fifty finely cut agates. Jarlaxle assures Firble that no power in Menzoberranzan is moving against Blingenstone itself, but that one House is desperately searching for a renegade. After some more dealing, Jarlaxle names the renegade as Drizzt Do'urden, and warns him that if they know anything about Drizzt, then to keep him far away. The goddess Lolth herself wants the boy dead, and she stops at nothing to get her wishes. <strong><em>\"Drizzt is doomed, and so doomed will be any foolish enough to stand beside him.\"</em></strong> Of course, Firble's reaction to the news confirms for Jarlaxle that the gnomes of Blingenstone indeed know of Drizzt and his whereabouts.</p><p>Firble hurries back to King Schnicktick with the news, who then promptly calls Drizzt to his presence. Drizzt had been enjoying his time among the gnomes since his return with the expedition. He had become something of a celebrity among the members of the mining group and their families, and so the summons to see the King was no surprise. The subject of the summons, however, was shocking to say the least.</p><p>The King announces his decision to put Drizzt out for the good of the city, a move with fairly enrages Belwar. Schnicktick explains that the increase of drow activity on their eastern border has been directly caused by Drizzt's presence, and Drizzt admits that his mother is continuing her search for him. Belwar is angered enough to directly berate his King, but Schnicktick says he has no further choice.</p><h3><em>\"To keep Drizzt here would invite war with Menzoberranzan, and I will not put Blingenstone in jeopardy for the sake of a dark elf, even if he has shown himself to be a friend.\"</em></h3><p>Drizzt says he will be gone within the hour, and he parts ways with nothing but gratitude in his heart.</p><p>Drizzt walks the streets of Blingenstone with Guen at his side. The citizens bow their heads with heavy hearts, hating what has become necessary for them to do. The drow and the great cat walk out of the gates of the stone walled city, and they thud shut behind him. He wondered how long he would be able to survive in the Underdark alone again but for the sometime companionship of Guenhwyvar. His kind measured their lifespans in centuries, and he had nearly lost himself to the Hunter in only a decade. How could he make it alone for hundreds of years?</p><p>Strolling through the gate, the pair are met by Belwar, who has decided to leave his home behind and join Drizzt in the dangerous Underdark. Drizzt is loathe to let him come along, but Belwar will not take no for an answer, taking off from the city walls and into the deepening darkness before the drow could stop him. The first thing they do is set up a false camp about a day's march from Blingenstone's walls to create a diversion for whoever it was tracking them. They then set off in the opposite direction, into the caverns west of the Svirfnebli city. Traveling only to stop when hunger or weariness overtook them. Along the way, Belwar would point out places to which he had been before on mining expeditions, and Drizzt began to wonder how many ways a gnome could talk about mining and carving stone. The elf hung on every word, knowing that the alternative was silence, and then the Hunter would come. With Belwar at his side, they entered the more dangerous parts of the Underdark, fighting off the natural monsters of the deep places, but never losing himself to the Hunter again. Belwar's companionship was the cure to his aching loneliness.</p><p>After walking for weeks and weeks, they come upon a cavern that is glowing with a bright light, and so they move to investigate. They enter a vast cavern filled with a sea of acidâthe source of the lightâand find the greatest danger they had yet faced. Set upon by overwhelming numbers of bird-men, the trio back into a tight defensive circle. Belwar slams his new \"hands\" together, yelling the magical gnomish word <strong><em>\"Bivrip!\"</em></strong>, filling his implements with glowing magic which gives huge weight and force to his blows as they fight against the creatures. They fight for quite a while, but are sorely outnumbered.</p><p>Drizzt is able to hold it together until Guenhwyvar is knocked off the bridges above the glowing sea and into the acid bath itself. When Guen roars in pain, Drizzt uses the figurine to will the panther back to her home on the astral plane. Though severely hurt, Guen will recover and be fine within a few day, but the pain would be remembered. Because of the pain, Drizzt called up the Hunter and allowed him to take over. Belwar is left to watch in both horror and amazment as he sees the greatest display of warrior skill and swordsmanship he would ever experience. Drizzt was too fast, too precise, too deadly and seemed unreal to Belwar. It was as if his best friend had become Death itself.</p><p>Finally, even with the help of the Hunter, they are forced to flee, and Belwar has to eventually call out for Drizzt to stop, otherwise he would have run himself to exhaustion. Drizzt is full of fear that he let himself give sway to the Hunter again. He confessess to Belwar that he felt possessed by rage, his only desire was to kill them all, not out of self-defense, but out of darkness. Belwar tells him he was not acting out of rage, but rather out of instinct. <strong><em>\"You saved us this day, Drizzt Do'urden. Do not apologize to me, or to yourself.\"</em></strong></p><h3>The Cavern: A Home Away from Home</h3><p>The pair continues on their journey. Drizzt calls Guen back to him after three days, here fur is singed, but otherwise she was fine and glad to see her friend. A few days later, they stumbled over exactly what they had been looking for, even though they had not exactly known they were searching. They come to a cavern with an underground lake fed by a fresh-running stream. It is small enough for the two of them to defend, and the lake would provide them with ample fish and crab for their sustenence. They were home.</p><p>Across the wilds of the Underdark, on the other side of Blingenstone, Zaknafein has found their fake encampment, and is in a rage over his continued failure to find his prey. It takes all of Malice's strength of will to reign him in and send him back on his way. Malice, though growing slightly weaker each day, warns her daughters to test her rule. Malice vows that she will remain strong, and that she will one day soon hold Drizzt heart in her hand, <strong><em>\"No matter what the cost, we will triumph.\"</em></strong></p><p>One day later, Drizzt and Belwar hear curious sounds outside their cavern. Drizzt remembers those sounds, and races out of the cavern yelling <strong><em>\"Hook Horror!\"</em></strong>Outside, he finds exactly what he thought it was, and gets his scimitars on the creatures neck, about to strike the killing blow. Just then, the monster speaks, something he believed a hook horror incapable of doing.<strong><em>\"No...not...monster..please..no..kill..me!\"</em></strong> the thing manages to squawk. Drizzt stays his hand, and the creature says it is not a hook horror, but rather a thing called a <em>\"pech\"</em>. Belwar knows of the pech by the name rock children, creatures whose only reason for being seems to be rock carving, and their numbers are very small. The pech tells that it was turned into a hook horror by an evil wizard, and does not know how long it has been that way, having lost all sence of time because it is no longer connected to the stone in its present form.</p><p>When Belwar asks the creature its name, it either does not have one, or it has forgotten, so Belwar names it <em>\"Clacker,\"</em> a name which the pech approves. Belwar then intends to say goodbye to the creature and send it on its way, but Drizzt says they must allow it to be with them. Drizzt has pity on the creature, feeling akin to the creature being adrift and apart from itself, something similar to what he feels when he is overtaken by the Hunter. Belwar still thinks it is a bad idea, because a spell such as the one Clacker has undergone changes not only the body, but the mind as well, and in time he will cease to be a pech even in mind, but just a hook horror, and then he will be a great danger. Drizzt insists that they track down the wizard who did it, and then force him to unmake the spell.</p><p>One day later, Drizzt and Belwar hear curious sounds outside their cavern. Drizzt remembers those sounds, and races out of the cavern yelling <strong><em>\"Hook Horror!\"</em></strong>So, the next day, they followed as Clacker tried to retrace his step to where the wizards was. The creature was easily confused, his memory clouded because of his transformation, and so he got them lost numerous time. Just as they were about to become too tired to go on, the entered a great tavern that was dominated by a huge tower made of pure adamantite. Belwar stands in awe at the sight, for adamantite is the toughest substance known in Faerun, and just a small amount is worth a king's ransom, and extrememly hard to work with. <strong><em>\"How did he build such a thing?\"</em></strong> the gnome asks. <strong><em>\"Magic,\"</em></strong> is Drizzt's reply, with more than a hint of disdain in his voice.</p><p>Drizzt's plan is to hide until the wizard appears, and then take him by surprise, but Clacker in his rage chooses otherwise. He rushes the tower and begins striking it with his claws, calling on the wizard to show himself. Drizzt and Belwar rush to the pech's aid, just as a bolt of lightning comes from above, forcing Drizzt to shove the pitiful creature out of the way. From inside the tower, the wizard rages, <strong><em>\"Damnation! You ist going to pay dearly for that one. I vill keell you all!\"</em></strong> (a german wizard?) Drizzt pulls out Guenhwyvar's figurine and holds it up near one of the bolt-holes carved in the adamantite tower's surface. When he calls on her, he will her to appear inside the walls, and the smoke that comes from the figurine that marks her appearance wafts through the crack and into the tower. Drizzt calls on the wizard to open the tower, to which he momentarily refuses, but then Guen's roar behind him persuades him otherwise.</p><p>Inside the tower, they see an empty octaganal chamber with only a wooden ladder leading up to the higher levels. Drizzt is somewhat taken aback to find a human living alone in the vastness of the underdark. Though he is a wizard, he is very nervous around Guen, perhaps not possessing the magical might necessary to hold her off if she chose to attack. Drizzt insists that the wizard, Brister Fendlestick, change Clacker back. He seems to be amenable to the deal, if for no other reason than to be rid of his unwanted visitors. As Brister retrieves his spellbook, the quips <strong><em>\"Pech, useless little things,\"</em></strong> which sets Clacker off. Before either of his new friends can stop him, Clacker rushes the wizard, cutting him apart before he can defend himself. His only hope of restoration is now dead at his own hands.</p><p>Back in Menzoberranzan, Matron Baenre consults with Jarlaxle on the health of Malice Do'urden. The zin-carla has lasted very long, the second longest ever, and the spirit-wraith of Zaknafein grows stronger each day. Jarlaxle also reports that Zaknafein has follwed Drizzt past Blingenstone, and into the \"unpopulated\" caverns of the west. <strong><em>\"Unpopulated?\"</em></strong> Baenre scoffs. <strong><em>\"Hardly. There are things living in those tunnels, Jarlaxle. Dangerous things.\"</em></strong> Unknown to them both, Baenre's illithid councilor is eavesdropping on their conversation, and he is highly interested in what they have to say.</p><p>The trio left the tower in silence. What Clacker had done was something no rational being would have perpetrated, but rather the act of a wild animal. Drizzt was beginning to believe that Belwar spoke the truth, that Clacker was slowly becoming more and more the monster each day. He hoped that when they reached the safety of their cavern home, they might find some other way to help the poor creature.</p><p>When they reached their home, they foudn it in total disarray. Belwar wondered if the bird-men had tracked them down, but Drizzt recognized the fine cuts in the belongings, the mark of a drow blade. Drizzt believes that his mother's assassins have tracked him down again, and so they abandon the only home Drizzt had ever felt he could completely call his own. The three of them pick up what few belongings remain intact, and run all the way through the day and long into the night without stopping, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the evil drow. Eventually, they come to a cavern that is wide open, and seemingly a good place for habitation, but it is emply. Not only is it empty, but it seems totally devoid of any signs of life. <strong><em>\"This isn't right,\"</em></strong> Belwar says warily. <strong><em>\"It's too quiet.\"</em></strong> Suddenly, the three of them are hit by an unseen psionic force, and knocked unconscious. From the shadows, a group of illithids float into the cavern and hover over their fallen victims.</p><h3>Illithid Castle: Slave of the Mind Flayers</h3><p>Drizzt, Belwar, and Clacker find themselves leading new lives with no memories of their former lives. The illithids who captured them have used them for their own comfort and benefit. Clacker has been put to work on an isolated island of rock, accessable only via a small, thin hanging bridge.</p><p>On this island dwells the illithid's herd of rothe, and Clacker has been forced to become not only the herd's protector, but the butcher as well. Clacker knows something is wrong, but his mind has been so clouded since his transformation by the evil wizard he cannot begin to unravel how things should be.</p><p>The illithids, creatures who rightly claimed the title of <em>\"mind flayers,\"</em> using their inborn psionic abilities to twist the minds and desires of any creature that comes into their clutches. Creatures with enough skill were sent down into the mines to dig for jewels and precious metals. The more bestial creatures were sent to the areana to fight for sport, the illithids betting on each match. When such servants grew old, or outlived their usefulness, they became dinner as a final service to their master. Illithids could turn violent being docile, and the wildest animal into a domesticated pet. In turn, they could change a peace-loving individual into a violent and warlike barbarian. Such was the case with Belwar.</p><p>Belwar brought the highest price ever paid for a slave because he was well suited for the two most popular uses of slaves, the mines and the arena. The six illithids who had captured the three wanderers had made a great deal of profit on their catch, and were able to keep a magic item back from being auctioned off, the onyx figurine of Guenhwyvar. They were determined to learn its secrets.</p><p>Drizzt found himself in the center of the illithid castle as a servant to the Central Brain. Whenever drow or other nimble-fingered sentients were captured, they were sent to tend the brain, a great exposed mass of pink matter that served as the coordinator for the illithid's entire existence. Though the mind flayers still had great psionic powers individually, the Central Brain magnified and organized their powers as a group, allowing the existence they loved so well. They worshiped the thing essentially as their god. Drizzt was set to work using his hands to sooth the brain and to offer it vital fluids. The drow's entire purpose now became to tend the brain mass and please his new masters.</p><p>In the gladiatorial arena, Belwar is set to fight an ogre by his master, being told telepathically that beast had threatened the master, and that he should kill it. Belwar attacks with a ferocity not seen since the day he and his mining expedition had been attacked by Drizz't patrol group. He was severely outmuscled though, and was quickly in danger of losing his life. His illithid master frantically searched his new servant's mind to find an advantage, and locked onto the trigger word that activated the magic of Belwar's hands. Once this was done, the battle's outcome was a forgone conclusion, the Svirfnebli killing the huge ogre. So glad was Belwar to have \"rescued\" his master, he beamed a smile through his gore covered face.</p><p>Outside the walls of the illithid castle, in the same open cavern where Drizzt and his companions had been captured, yet another drow warrior made his approach. Zaknafein, the spirit-wraith under the influence of Malice's zin-carla ritual, had traked his quarry to the illithid territory. When four of the illithids who had captured the others tried their mind trickery on Zak, nothing happened, he was immune. In short order, he slew all four of the mind flayers and made his way to the castle gates uncontested.</p><p>While all this is going on, Guenhwyvar has been trapped on the astral plane. She remained unworried, it was not the first time Drizzt had not summoned her immdiately after her rest period, and she was busying herself hunting the entity of the Elk.</p><p>Hidden in the astral shadows were the remaining two illithid slavers, having finally deduced what the onyx figurines purpose was. They were observing Guen on her hunt, evaluting her worth and salivating at the weath she would bring her in the arena. Though they thought themselves hidden, Guen sensed the two and immediately recognized them as an enemy. She attacks, killing the astral presence of one, causing its death on the material plane. Then she does the extraordinary. Using the still living illithid as a portal, she jumps through its astral presence into the material plane, ripping it to shreds in the process. Scenting out Drizzt, she runs off into the hallways of the castle.</p><p>At that same instant, Zaknafein strode through the gates of the illithid castle, moving down mind flayers, guards and slaves alike. Zak knew that Drizzt was near, and he would let nothing stand in his way, the only thing that would salve the raging beast in his breast would be the death of his son at the end of his blades. Far above, Guen barreled down the endless flight of stairs, carrying Drizzt's scimitars on her back and her figurine in her maw. Taking numerous blows, she found opportunity to take a short cut by jumping over the railing and down to the central chamber below, landing directly in the Central Brain, killing it instantly.</p><p>All over the castle, illithids were driven down to their knees, wailing horribly in pain. Already in confusion from both Zak's arrival and Guen's romp through the castle the illithids were not equipped to deal with the fallout of the death of their god. As soon as the connections between masters and slaves were broken, slaves began revolting all over the castle, Belwar among them. Without thinking twice, he rose up against his former master and slew him with a stroke. Down in the bowels of the castle, Clacker was released from his bondage, and the hook horror aspect of his transformation took full control. Guen and Drizzt are reunited, and are immediately thrust into battle against Drizzt's overseer, a fight ended quickly by a sharp scimitar.</p><p>Running through they castle, they meet up with Belwar and then race to find Clacker. When they find him, his is fully taken with hook horror rage, and Drizzt must draw his blades to defend himself. He is able to stop, and regains himself, and the quartet runs towards the gate together, Clacker leading the way towards a back entrance. Near that entrance, Drizzt's world falls apart as he sees his father alive and fighting his way through a mass of remaining slaves. Drizzt rushes to see his father, but is met with sharp blades and a mindless rage. In his confusion, Drizzt realizes that it may be his father's body he is meeting, but it is not his father's mind or soul that are in control, and he is overwhelmed by the fierceness of the attack.</p><p>As Zaknafein raises his blades for a killing strike, Clacker see his friend in dire harm and mumbles something unintelligible. From the path between the battling drow raises a solid wall of stone, separating the two from one another and allowing Drizzt to flee out the back entrance. Zak, blocked by the wall, is unable to follow. Back in Menzoberranzan, the stain of keeping Zak under control is nearly overwhelming for Malice, and her health is nearly gone. He daughters continue to test her, but she tells them she will not fail.</p><p>After Drizzt and the others put some distance between themselves and the illithid castle, he tells them that their attacker had been his father whom he thought had been sacrificed to the Spider Goddess. Drizzt then thanks Belwar for creating the wall and allowing them to escape. Belwar is confused, and states that such magic is beyond his skill, whereupon Clacker admits it was his doing. He tells of the pech and their connection to the earth, speaking of it as if it were a living, breathing thing. <strong><em>\"It is, for those who can hear it,\"</em></strong> he says. <strong><em>\"Yes, pech know that stone best of all. Better than even dwarves or gnomes. For and instant I was not this monster, I was pechâmore pech than ever before. But now, I am falling\"</em></strong></p><h3>Toward Menzoberranzan: Gains and Losses</h3><p>Drizzt determines they must help Clacker before it is too late, so he turns their direction back toward Menzoberranzan. When Belwar protest, Drizzt says that his former home is full of wizards who can undo the polymorph spell. When Belwar points out the danger to Drizzt, and asks what they could possibly offer a drow wizard in exchange for such a service. <strong><em>\"The wizard's life,\"</em></strong> is Drizzt's baleful reply.</p><p>Matron Malice is called before Baenre, and encouraged to not lose heart. The price of an extended zin-carla was high, but the death of her son would put Malice strongly back into the favor of Lolth, and give her further blessings as well,</p><h3><em>\"glory and power beyond imagining.\"</em></h3><p>Baenre warns Malice, that if she falters, then the spirit-wraith will as well, being an extension of the matron's will. Malice is also worried that another house will attack while Malice is weakened and out of favor. Baenre assures he that she herself will see to House Do'urden's protection.</p><p>Drizzt leads his three friends as fast as he can back toward the hated drow city. In time, they came back to the familiar sight of the acid sea, home of the dreaded bird-men. Realistically, they should go around the dangerous cavern, but Drizzt was concerned that every spare moment would count, and every second lost would hasten Clacker being lost to the monster inside. When they enter the cavern, they find it completely empty, no sign of the bird-men remains. They wonder if they cleared them out the last time they passed through, or is someone else had. Clacker reaches the end of the cavern and exits, letting out a blood-curdling scream. Clacker comes back into the cavern with a gaping chest wound and falls over dead. He finally reverts back to his original form, finding the peace in death that his life had cheated from him.</p><p>From the shadows springs Zaknafein, his blades flying. <strong><em>\"You're not my father,\"</em></strong> Drizzt yells. Another voice comes through Zak's mouth, <strong><em>\"No. I am... your mother.\"</em></strong> Malice presses the attack, slashing Drizzt across the cheek, a move which makes Drizzt finally give in to the Hunter. Even with the added advantage of fighting purely on skill and instinct, Zak fought his son to a standstill. This makes Drizzt think that Zak is still inside the undead body somewhere, so he lowers his scimitars and refuses to fight.</p><p>Malice takes the advantage, and moves Zak for a killing blow, but the old weapons-master pulls his blades just short of his son's neck. Malice screams at him over their connection, and Zak is able to strike back and momentarily overcome the control. Zak, the real Zak is now back in control, but he warns Drizzt back. Drizzt thinks they can be together again, but Zak explains that he is still dead, and would rather return to death than cause harm to his son. He tells Drizzt how proud he is of him for not only his fighting skill, but even more so for his courage to do what he had never done and leave Menzoberranzan.</p><p>As Zak begins to loose control of himself again, he proclaims his pride for his son one last time. <strong><em>\"I do this for us,\"</em></strong> he yells, and casts himself from the earthen bridge and into the acid sea below. Malice screams and blacks out from the mental backlash, and Briza strikes her with her snake-headed whip and claims the throne of House Do'urden. As she does so, Dinin runs into the room and tells them they are under attack. Incredulous, Maya bellows, <strong><em>\"Who would dare? House Baenre protects us!\"</em></strong> To which Dinin replies, \"No, Maya, House Baenre attacks us.\" Because of the failure of Malice, Baenre has come to oversee the fall of a House from its pedestal, having earned the severe disfavor of their goddess.</p><p>In short order, the Do'urden daughters are killed in the battle. In the Do'urden throne room, Briza is slain by Jarlaxle, who comes to offer Dinin a place among Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle sees an able leuitentant and swordman in Dinin, and would hate to see such a one go to a useless death.</p><p>Drizzt and Belwar bury Clacker, and also raise a beir for Zaknafein, believing he deserved a proper grave to mark his passing from the world. Belwar prayed to his gods for the soul of Clacker, while Drizzt, having forsaken his people's evil goddess, hoped that his father was finally at peace. Their trials over, they head to Blingenstone, Belwar believing they can go back and live in the city in peace now that Drizzt was no longer hunted. When they come to the city gates, Drizzt tells Belwar he cannot stay, and means to depart to yet another place in an effort to get further away from his evil kind, and take their vengeance toward him as far as possible from the only people he had ever met and truly come to care for.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-117003\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2775\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-117003\"><img alt=\"Friends Parting Ways\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Friends Parting Ways\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1494/117003-26585-drizzt-do-urden.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Friends Parting Ways</figcaption></figure><p>Belwar insists he come with Drizzt, but Drizzt will not allow it and bids a final farewell and thank you. Calling Guenhwyvar from her astral home, the two of them travel for weeks, Drizzt retracing his steps along a path he had travels well over a decade before. He could no longer stay in the Underdark. Even though his mother was dead and his House fallen, Lolth and Baenre would not rest until they had tracked him down and slain him. He also could not stay lest the madness of the Hunter claim him forever, so there was only one place left to go.</p><h2>Sojourn</h2><h3>Near Malobar: A Hundred Dawns</h3><p>Before long, Drizzt's favorite part of the day in his new world was the sunrise. The sun, which his people hated with unreasoning fear, became a companion and guardian to him. His lavender eyes were stung by its great light, and he might never grow used to the intensity, but he accepted the pain as a necessity to become a creature of the surface world. Drizzt was now forty years old, still a chld by the measure of his people, but his life-experience was well beyond that of most sentient creatures, regardless of their race.</p><p>Drizzt was forced to adapt to this new world in ways he had not thought of before. He knew of the sun and its great light, and exposure of not having miles of solid rock surrounding him on all sides, but other things were beyond his knowledge. Biting winds that chilled him to the bone in the early morning were unheard of in the always mildly-warm Underdark. His magical items (piwafwi cloak, drow armor, scimitars) were slowly sapped of their enchantments by the sunlight. These, and other unforeseen difficulties, forced Drizzt to adapt. He had survived in the Underdark for a decade when everyone said it was impossible, he would survive and thrive on the surface.</p><p>Taking up residence in a small mountain cave, Drizzt spent his days roaming the countryside around a farming community down in the valley below. He was trying to gather the courage to introduce himself to his neighbors, when he is met by a pack of gnolls, doglike humanoids that are often kept as slaves by drow in the Underdark. This pack sees Drizzt as a friend, owing to the drow reputation for violence and cruelty, and ask him to come along as they go to kill their enemies. Not entirely trusting the creatures, but not wanting to immediately mistrust them, he went along until they came to a farmstead down in the valley near Malobar. When Drizzt asks the gnoll leader's intentions, he is answered with, <strong><em>\"Enemies. Kill oldest woman, catch men.\"</em></strong> When Drizzt asks, <strong><em>\"What of the children?\"</em></strong> he is met with the reply, <strong><em>\"Dinner.\"</em></strong></p><p>Now knowing that the gnolls are evil, and the family below innocent, Drizzt quickly draws his scimitar and slays the leader. He and Guenhwyvar quickly finish off the remaining two, leaving them in puddles of blood. When it was over, Drizzt began to second guess himself. He was new to the surface world. Who was he to judge the gnolls in such a way. Perhaps the humans and gnolls were at war with one another, and the gnolls had had relatives killed by someone in the human family. Drizzt needed time alone to learn more and consider further action. He sends Guen home and begins observing the family. He soon sees that they are a happy family of hard, honest workers. Within three days he is assured he had made the right decision in killing the gnolls. This family was good, and he vowed to protect them to the death.</p><p>Up in the mountains, much higher than Drizzt's cave home, dwelt two creatures of Gehenna called barghests. Demonic creatures, they were near maturity and had been sent to the material plane to feed on the flesh of humans and grow strong enough to return home. Ulgulua, the older of the two, is informed by one of their servants of the slaying of the gnoll by a drow. In anger, Ulgulu bites the head off the messenger, and conferes with his brother, Kempfana, as to what they should do about a dark elf in their domain. Kempfana suggests that they use the drow as a scapegoat to explain the disappearances that have occurred since they came to the area. Ulgulu decides to investigate and sends his pet quickling, Tephanis, to gather more information.</p><p>One day, when the youngest Thistledown child, Liam, shirks his chores and wanders off into the forest, Drizzt follows to ensure his safety. The boy accidentally discovers Drizzt, who, though he was stealthy, was still ignorant of woodlore. Liam runs home and tells his siblings of the dark skinned elf he saw in the woods. Liam convinces his older brother and sister into a ruse to try and flush Drizzt out, and they reluctantly agree. Drizzt, seeing through the ruse easily, decides to play along. When the maiden, Eleni, acts as if she has fallen, Drizzt reveals himself and hopes to make himself known as a friend. Conner, the oldest boy, immediatly recognizes Drizzt as a drow, draws his sword, and races to attack. Though Conner is skilled by local standards, Drizzt easily disarms the boy and offers him his sword back, a drow sign of friendship. Conner and the others panic and run back home as fast as they can. In the bushes, Drizzt has been seen by another set of eyes who are not so friendly.</p><p>By the next morning, the entire community of Malobar had heard the rumor of the dark elf. The town's mayor, Bartholomew Delmo sends a request to nearby Sundabar for a ranger to come and help deal with situation. A local huntsman, Roddy McGristle, is skeptical that Conner saw what he says he saw, but volunteers himself to track whatever creature this might be, and organizes a search party on the spot. That afternoon, a body of men were led into the nearby forest by Roddy's bloodhounds, and Drizzt shadowed them easily. He wanted to reveal himself, but understood they would likely see him as an enemy. While lost in his reverie, the quickling Tephanis dashes by, slashing Drizzt's wrist and stealing a scimitar. Drizzt cries out, in surprise more than pain, and is heard by Roddy and his dogs. Calling on Guenhwyvar as a distraction, Drizzt hoped to get away, but the bloodhounds have clearly picked up his scent and catch up to him easily. When one bursts through the brush to attack, Drizzt cuts it down instinctively, and finds himself in a battle with Roddy. Not desiring to hurt the hunter, he dashed and ducked out of the way. Roddy's great battleaxe caught on a nearby tree, cutting in down to fall on top of him, smashing him in the face. Drizzt runs as quickly as he can and loses himself in the forest.</p><p>Later that night, the barghest Ulgulu comes down off of his mountain carrying the stolen scimitar of Drizzt. All barghests are shape-shifters, and so Ulgulu took on the form of Drizzt and strode into the farmhouse of the Thistledowns. As Conner and his father, Conner Sr., sat discussing the events of the day's hunt, the false drow bursts into their home, slaughtering the entire family. The next morning, Drizzt warily came down out of the mountains, hoping the search was no longer on. He hoped to reveal himself to the Thistledowns and make his peace with the locals, but when he arrives no one is yet stirring about the farm. Drizzt decides to sit and wait, but when there has been no activity from morning through late afternoon to evening, he began to sense something was amiss. He walks down and into the house, finding the murdered Thistledowns in gruesome display all about the house. Drizzt was shocked with his failure to protect the family, and immediately vowed to avenge their deaths.</p><p>The next morning, Drizzt takes his weapons and Guen and trudges up into the mountains, where all the signs of the murderous creature pointed. As they neared the hiding place of his new enemy, he heard the familiar sound of the running creature that had stung him and stole his scimitar. Not caugh unawares this time, he catches the little beast, a quickling name Tephanis, and forces to tell him who killed the farmers. After giving the name and location of the barghest Ulgulu, the green-skinned little creature stabs Drizzt in the hand to try and get away, but Drizzt ignores the pain, smashes the quickling against a rock, and throws it down into the valley below. He pulls the tiny dagger out of his hand and walks on.</p><p>At the barghest's cave, he is confronted by two goblins, which he promptly slays and enters the cave. Inside, he finds the two demonic fiends standing inside, and immediately slips into The Hunter. Ulgulu, thinking he's found easy prey and a final meal on the material plane, jumps toward the drow, but is stopped in mid-air by Guen. Drizzt turns to attack Kempfana, and is forced to hop around in order to stay out of the huge beast's reach. Ulgulua shapeshifts into a great demon wolf after Guen bites him in the shoulder, and chases Guen from the cave. Kempfana, meanwhile, has caught Drizzt and is holding him up by the neck. When the barghest opens his mouth to bite off Drizzt's head, the dark elf shoves his scimitar through the back of the demon's mouth, impaling his brain. Released, Drizzt rushes out to see Ulgulu trap Guen near the canyon edge. When the demon wolf jumps, Drizzt uses the figurine to send Guen home, causing Ulgulu to miss entirely and plummet to the canyon floor below.</p><p>Back down in the town of Malobar, at the Thistledown farm, the renowned tracker Dove Falconhand has arrived to investigate recent events. Though she has arrived too late to prevent the family's murder, she is determined to track down the perpetrator. Joining Dove are her three most trusted traveling companions, Gabriel, a human warrior, Kellindil, an elven archer, and Fret, a dwarven sage. Having already been informed of the rumors of a dark elf, Dove and her group begin investigating the family farmstead. Pieces do not add up, such as a shattered lock, something beyond the ability of even the strongest elf. The inconsistencies are explained away by the arrival of Roddy McGristle, who blames such thing on the drow's \"big black panther.\"</p><p>Though Dove believes that Roddy did indeed see and tangle with a drow, she is mistrustful of his motives. He blames the killing of a beloved dog and his facial scarring on the drow, and is obviously looking for some kind of vengeance. Mayor Delmo tells Dove that they will take McGristle with them because <strong><em>\"he's a seasoned hunter and knows this area better than any.\"</em></strong> Dove is troubled by the news, but does not argue. Some of Dove's doubts do disappear after Gabriel discovers a shattered scimitar inside the Thistledown home, coated in human blood. Questions still remain, after Kellindil points out two sets of identical elven footprints, made a day apart. But one set is deeper, indicating too massive a weight for an elf's steps. Further, Fret points out a ceiling beam snapped nearly in half, a feat too great for either a drow or a panther.</p><p>Hiding in the bushes nearby, Drizzt listens to the conversations of those now employed to find them. Though he wished to reveal himself and explain everything that had happened, how it had all been perpetrated by Ulgulu, and how he himself avenged the Thistledown family's deaths, he knew he could not. As soon as the color of his skin was seen, he would be attacked and given no quarter. Returning to his cave, he gathered his things and fled the area surrounding Malobar.</p><p>Dove and her fellow investigators come upon the body of Ulgulu in the canyon, making note of the claw marks all over the creatures body. Kellindil then reports that there is another beast, a red one, and two goblins up above, both killed by scimitar. When Dove asks, <strong><em>\"Why would the dark elf kill the barghest?\"</em></strong> Fret immediately deduces the correct answer. <strong><em>\"Don't you see? Somehow the barghest acquired one fo the scimitars, then, in the shape of the drow, murdered the farmers.\"</em></strong> In a rage, Roddy McGristle will hear nothing of the theory, challenging the dwarf to call him a liar. Finding further drow footprints leading away from the canyon, Dove and her crew move onward, her doubts remaining still.</p><h3>Northwestern Faerun: On the Run</h3><p>Drizzt ran ahead of them, moving day and night, not daring to stop until exhausted. He used every trick he knew to evade them, running through streams and swimming lakes, doubling back on his own tracks, even jumping from tree to tree. Nevertheless, Dove and her crew was too skilled to be evaded, and stayed unerringly on his trail. Dove's own group pushed themselves to exhaustion, not daring to let a drow be loose on the surface world, even if they had their doubts about his guilt. None of them, except for McGristle had ever actually seen a drow, and the last reported sighting of one on the surface had been ten years before. Unknown to the trackers, Drizzt had been a part of that group, saving the life of a small elfin girl while his patrol group massacred the rest of the settlement. Based solely on the reputation of the drow race, they were obligated to track him down and learn his intentions.</p><p>One night, while encamped, Kellindil notices they are being watched, and shoots his arrow into the brush, hitting Guenhwyvar in the flank. She runs back to Drizzt, who pulls the arrow from her side. <strong><em>\"So now we know their intentions,\"</em></strong> Drizzt tells her. <strong><em>\"How far will you hunt me? We shall see.\"</em></strong></p><p>Behind him in the next day's light, Dove is still tracking the dark elf. He was very good, but he made just enough mistakes that they could find clues as to his direction. If his woodcraft had been better, he might have been able to elude them entirely, but being a creature most suited to living underground where foilage was not an issue in tracking, he was at a clear disadvantage. If not for his speed, agiliy, and intelligence, they might have caught him nearly immediately. Drizzt himself gave them the largest advantage by refusing to put greater distance between himself and his pursuers. Each night he would work his way back to a position where he could watch their camp, the arise early enough to get a good head start. In his heart, Drizzt's true wish was to walk out of the shadows, explain everything to them, and ask to be a part of their world. Fear and experience, however, held him back from such a move.</p><p>It was on one of these nights that he was finally discovered. Kellindil had been patroling the perimeter of the camp, and came up on Drizzt. <strong><em>\"At last we have met, my dark cousin,\"</em></strong> the light elf told him. At first, Drizzt was glad he had been discovered. He dreamed of sharing his trials and experiences with his light skinned cousin, and professing his hatred of his own race. <strong><em>\"My name isâ\"</em></strong> he began, but was cut off as Kellindil drew a sword, proclaiming, <strong><em>\"I don't care what you call yourself!\"</em></strong> Kellindil only cared that Drizzt was a drow, and therefore immediately assumed him an evil creature. Drizzt refused to even draw his sword, even when Kellindil swiped at his head. He easily dodged the swing, and used his innate drow ability to created a glow of darkness, placing it around the light elf's head. Kellindil quickly jumped out of the globe, but not before Drizzt could have easily drawn a scimitar and taken his head. When he was clear of the darkness, Drizzt was gone, leaving Kellindil alone with his doubts. <strong><em>\"He could have killed me. Why didn't he?\"</em></strong></p><p>While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him.</p><p>When Roddy McGristle announces that they need to hurry before the drow gets away, Dove announces, <strong><em>\"We shall pursue the dark elf no longer. He was never our enemy.\"</em></strong> When Roddy explodes in exasperated anger against her pronouncement, Dove calmly explains that Gabriel is wounded, Kellindil is nearly out of arrows, and their supplies are nearly gone. Even if she still believed the drow to be a murderer, they would no longer be able to keep on the move without rest and restocking, something impossible in the Northern wilds. Furthermore, Dove states here belief that it was Drizzt who avenged the Thistledowns and slew the barghests. Dove and her men turn to leave, Roddy calling them cowards to their backs as they leave him alone in the bloody canyon.</p><p>Drizzt stayed on the move. It was soon apparent he was no longer being pursued, but he knew it would not be safe for him to stay in one place. In addition, the season was quickly changing from warm summer to cold winter, especially since he had been constantly moving north. The cold, unknown in the Underdark, was sapping his strength and causing him more difficulty than anything else he had yet encountered. He kept journeying until he came to a mountain pass with a river full of fish and rocky protection against the cold northern wind. He settled down, exposed in the open air, believing the cold could not possibly last long. He was sadly mistaken, having no concept of the turning of the seasons. As night fell, so too did the temperature, and Drizzt desperately worked at trying to start a fire using rock and steel. After many unsuccessful attempts, he was finally able to get a flame going, and Kellindil, who was still silently tracking him, was pleased to see that the drow would survive. Kellindil now decided he would stand watch over this strange drow that had shown him and his friends mercy and compassion when they would not. Unknown to them both, other sets of eyes watched the drow.</p><p>As days spread into weeks, Drizzt did the best he could to survive, still hoping the cold weather would not get worse. Then the snows began. Drizzt and Guenhwyvar set off in search of shelter, finding a cave. Upon entering, they find a bear just starting to bed down for winter hibernation. Drizzt stared the beast down, somehow finding a sort of unspoken understanding and accomodation. Offering the bear a fresh fish, the bear settled down and allowed the newcomers to share the cave, at least for the time being. Guenhwyvar, unaffected by the cold, foraged daily for the food and wood needed to keep the drow alive. Otherwise, Drizzt sat cold and alone in the cave, despairing as the weather produced more and more snow, and finally ice. Just when he believed he could bear no more, winter broke into spring, and the snows began to melt.</p><p>News of the dark elf's survival spread throughout the surrounding countryside, pleasing some with the news, but causing fear and trepidation in others. Minions of the Orc Chieftan Graul had seen the drow enter their environs before the snows set in, and Graul had commanded them to set a watch over him, but secretly hoped the snow would drive him away. Since that had not happened, and the dark elf had survived the winter, Graul wondered if this lone drow were a scout for a larger force to come, bringing war with them. If the drow were alone, he might come in and try to usurp leadership of his tribe. Neither situation could be allowed to stand, so he orders his men to go and kill the elf.</p><p>They found Drizzt walking through the local forest, enjoying his first spring. He was enamored by the new growth literally springing from the once dead ground. So enamored, in fact, he was caught by surprise by the attacking orcs. Drizzt easily killed the first two attackers, but was taken down by one of their feral wolves, pinned until he could call for Guenhwyvar. Even with the wolf off his back, he was severely disadvantaged, and would have been slain by a third orc if not for the timely intervention of an arrow in the beast's back. All enemies now dead, Drizzt looks up to see an old, green clad human bearing down on him with a great wooden bow. <strong><em>\"You're my prisoner,\"</em></strong> the newcomer stately matter of factly, to which Drizzt responds, <strong><em>\"I think not.\"</em></strong> Guen moves in to flank the human, and the man reaches out a hand to the great cat. Guen licks the old man's hand like an old friend.</p><p>Intrigued with the bearing and intent of Drizzt, the old man introduces himself as the ranger Montolio Debrouchee. Drizzt soon comes to realize that the man is blind, and is amazed that he could function well, let alone fire an arrow accurately in that condition. Montolio warns him that he had killed minions of Graul, something the Orc Chieftan will not allow to go unpunished. Because of his blindness, the orcs believe Montolio is \"bad magic\" and will not approach his castle. He tells Drizzt that coming to live with him is the safest place. Drizzt refuses, saying <strong><em>\"You would be better served, Montolio Debrouchee, to keep away from me. I bring trouble.\"</em></strong> Even after more prodding and assurances of safety from the old ranger, Drizzt still refuses. So, Montolio leaves Drizzt behind, taking Guenhwyvar with him. It was Guen's trust of the man that changed Drizzt heart. He knew that the great cat's instincts had never been wrong before, and he did not relish the idea of facing an army of orcs on his own.</p><h3>The Grove of Montolio: the Heart of a Ranger</h3><p>Drizzt follows Montolio to his \"castle,\" which in reality was a grove of massive trees reaching as high as could be seen. Each tree was a living house, whole rooms carved out of the tree's insides, this internal stairway reaching up into the highest regions of the grove. Wood and rope bridges connected the trees to one another, providing not only easy access across the heights, but also numerous positions from which to watch and defend the grove. In his short life, Drizzt had seen dwelling places more fantastic than this, but none more welcoming. Drizzt hoped that he had finally found a place to call home, but worried that something would find him and destroy it, despite the assurances of Montolio.</p><p>A week later, Kellindil is informed by a cousin of Drizzt's arrival in Montolio's grove. He is shocked at first to learn of the budding relationship between the drow and the ranger, but is now satisfied of Drizzt's friendly intentions. If Montlio trusted the drow, then he need no longer worry about the goodness of the dark elf's heart. In the bushes, yet another interested party has heard the news. Tephanis the quickling remembered the name Drizzt very well, for the dark elf had thrown the the little man to his death just months before. When he had recovered, he had found his former master, Ulgulu, dead at the bottom of the crevasse where he had fallen. Eventually, Tephanis found a new ally, Caroak, the Winter Wolf.</p><p>Winter Wolves have more akin to monsters and demons than animals, and so Caroak stood in opposition to everything that a ranger such as Montolio Debrouchee stood for. Hateful, but cautious, Caroak had always left Montolio alone, but now began thinking about how to dispose of both his hated enemy, and his new dangerous ally. In the grove below, Drizzt and Montolio began a long and fast friendship, his only real friend since leaving Belwar behind so many months ago. But more than friendship, Montolio began teaching Drizzt about the ways of the surface world, lessons that were critical to a ranger. He explained the seasons, how to anticipate changes in the weather, the behavior of animals, and the usefulness of plants. Drizzt learned to forage, and how to understand the emotions of an animal by observing its movements. Montolio knew he would progress, quickly, but was continually surprised by the demeanor of this drow, he lived and saw things as a surface elf might. In fact, he seems more attuned than many light elves Montolio had met, seemingly already possessing a natural ranger's heart.</p><p>Having been told of Drizzt's missing scimitar by the owl Hooter, Montolio takes the dark elf to a hidden armory and bestows on him a fine blade. When Drizzt thanks him for the blade and promises to care for it and only use it when he must, Montolio says, <strong><em>\"Oh, you'll use it now.\"</em></strong> At first, Drizzt thought it dishonorable to duel a blind opponent, but was eventually pressed into it by the old ranger. Battling with the flats of their blades, Drizzt found he was easily matched. When fighting in the dark, Drizzt often had the advantage over surface races because of his night vision, but what good was night vision against someone who could fight blind? Drizzt underestimated the old ranger, and was quickly put down. When Drizzt asks how he could have known, the blind man says, <strong><em>\"You told my yourself. In attitude. The suddden shuffle of your fee, the way your breathing changed as you prepared to leapâwhat you planned was obvious. You've much to learn, elf.\"</em></strong> He walked away, leaving the elf standing flatfooted.</p><p>When summer came, an unwanted visitor arrived, bringing all his usual bluster and lying with him, Roddy McGristle. He demanded to know from the ranger if he had seen the drow, or knew where he might be found. In addition, his lies about the dark elf continued to grow more extreme, reporting to Montolio that Drizzt had not only killed the Thistledown family, but that Guenhwyvar had also eaten one of them. Montolio lies and tells him he had heard the drow went to a place called Morueme's Cave, a place 150 miles in the opposite direction through treacherous terrain. After the evil man was gone, Drizzt came and pleaded his innocence to Montolio, something which the old ranger already knew, having spoken to Dove Falconhand, who had not only told of his innocence, but of his rescue of her and her men.</p><p>Later on, Montolio began to tell Drizzt about his own personal history. He had once been a warrior in addition to a ranger. He had given his life to the protection of the forest at an early age, and took up a life of adventuring, sometimes fighting with others, sometimes alone. He traveled the length and breadth of the north, putting to death monsters and unnatural things that were a threat to the natural order. His days of travel were abruptly ended, however, when he was washed in dragonfire from a great red dragon. The healers were able to heal him nearly completely, even the scarring of his skin, but were not able to save his eyes, leaving him in his blinded state. Montolio, despising the pity of his companions, came to the forest grove to die, but instead found purpose when he was visited by Mielikki, the mistress goddess of the forest.</p><p>In response to his tale, Drizzt says, <strong><em>\"I have no god, and nor do I want one.\"</em></strong> He goes on to tell about his disgust with his people and the evilness of Lolth, asserting that to follow a god is folly. He insists that he will follow his heart instead. Montolio counters by saying that Drizzt has a god, but just does not know its name. As proof, he points out the likeness of heart Drizzt shares with Guenhwyvar, and the great cat herself is the entity of the panther, a creature of Mielikki's domain. <strong><em>\"You know Mielikki's laws as well as I. You've been following them all your life, you just didn't know it.\"</em></strong> The ranger's words struck at the drow's heart, hitting him fully with the ring of truth, causing Drizzt to finally acquiesce and say, <strong><em>\"I-I wish to learn more our yourâour goddess.\"</em></strong></p><p>During all this time, Roddy McGristle had trudged halfway to the Nethers before he realized he had been duped. He finally determined that the ranger was trying to protect and hide the drow. Knowing he could not take on the ranger and drow alone, he turned and looked for allies, even such creatures he would normally never have contact with, Graul the Orc Chieftain. Roddy knew that Graul's minions had been unable to find the drow, so Roddy informed them he was with the ranger, and that they were plotting together against the orcs. A consummate liar, Roddy went on to convine the Orc Chieftain that they were planning on rousing all the elves, and dwarves, and forest animals against the orc tribe. This roused the ire of Graul, who then decides to muster his forces and attack the grove. At that moment, Tephanis and Caroak stride into the cave, promising to rouse the worgs against the ranger and his grove. The war was about to be joined. Hooter, having spied the preparations for the orc and worgs, flies back and tells Montolio of all he has seen. War is finally coming to the grove, a war which Montonlio had been prepared for for years.</p><p>Graul, Caroak, and Roddy were quickly successful in amassing a fairly large force in a short time, a group consisting of a hundred orc warriors, a few giants, and a dozen wargs. Together, they set out down the crags and crevasses of the high peaks and moved methodically toward the grove of Montolio below. In that very same grove, Montolio explained to Drizzt how he had known this night would come, expeciting it for five years. He had played out every possible scenario in his mind, and had stockpiled the necessary weapons and supplies to defend the grove all on his own. He now felt he had a greater advantage with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar at his side. So they began to prepare for the battle, readying weapons, calling in animal allies, and setting traps until all they could do was wait. They did not have long to rest.</p><p>From behind his seemingly overwhelming force, Graul calls for the attack. Orcs and wargs stream toward the grove, looking to tear apart any living thing they met, whether sentient being or plant. From high above on the rope bridges, Drizzt ran from crossbow to crossbow, each of which was already loaded with large bolts, and began firing into the crowd with deadly accuracy. He made every shot count, not daring to miss and lose any slight advantage over the attacking hoard. Montolio, hiding in the shadows, used the grunts and clanking armor to give him targets, their loudness creating beacon bright targets for the blind man. The bear Drizzt had bedded down with during his first winter, and other animals came out of the woods and slew orc after orc, quickly thinning the number of enemies against the grove's protectors.</p><p>While the battle is raging at the front entrance to the grove, Caroak and his wargs were sneaking into the grove through the thick growth behind the defenders. Their plan was to come up on them from behind and tear them apart, but little did they know the rear was guarded by the most silent, and possibly most deadly of the grove's defenders, Guenhwyvar. The black panther jumps on the winter wolf, and at first they seem evenly matched, Guen easily evades the freezing breath of the wolf and goes for the jugular. Caroak the Great Winter Wolf is dead, and the remaining wargs flee in terror.</p><p>When Drizzt gets to his last arrow, he finally sees McGristle in the fray below him. While he wanted to put his personal grief at an end by killing the lying hunter, he also spied the Orc Chieftain Graul next to him, and he reasoned that killing Graul would end the attack for good. His choice made, he fired at the orc, but Roddy noticed the arrow at the last moment and pushed the orc out of the way. Drizzt's final shot had been wasted. All the traps have been sprung, and both Montolio and the drow were out of arrows, so they drew their swords and leaped headlong into the remaining enemies. Whether orc, warg or giant, the two rangers were more than a match for their enemies, leaving no recourse but to run from the grove as fast as their feet would carry them. Even after all this, Roddy prodded Graul to go in himself and fight back, believing the two of them were more than a match for the rangers. Graul knew his men would follow him if he led another charge, but the Orc Chieftain was not one to risk his own life. He bashed Roddy upside the head, knocking him unconscious, and ran for his life. The battle was over.</p><p>Hours later, when Roddy awoke, Tephanis found him and convinced him that not only was the battle over, but that Drizzt had been killed by a warg. Believing the tale, Roddy felt his vengeance was satisfied, but was disappointed he had not killed the dark elf himself. They left the grove, Tephanis taking Roddy as his new master.</p><p>Life in the grove returned to normal, and Montolio and Drizzt passed the remainder of the summer peacefully. Montolio taught Drizzt everthing there was to know about every plant and animal in the region, but more importantly, Montolio taught him how to learn for himself. Drizzt learned to observe the world around him, looking and listening for the hints that Mielikki gave him in his heart. When fall came, Montolio began to slow down dramatically, he tired easily, and suffered from back and joint pain. He warned Drizzt that his time in the world would not last much longer, and that the drow should prepare for what comes next. When Drizzt says he will stay and watch over the grove, Montolio tells him it is not the life for the young drow, and makes him promise he will leave the grove and go in search of his place in the world. Reluctantly, Drizzt does just that.</p><p>One day, while foraging for the food to store fo the coming winter, Drizzt arrived back at the grove just as the first snows were beginning to fall. Usually, the grove was full of life, birds flitting around and animals playing beneath the trees. This day, everything was silent, and suddenly Drizzt knew the day he had been dreading had finally come. He rushed through the grove, finding Montolio resting against one of his beloved trees, finally at his eternal peace. Drizzt buried Montolio in the midst of the grove, then waited out the winter in the safety and warmth of the grove. Montolio's favorite animal, the owl Hooter, stayed on until one day late in the season, then he took flight and never returned. When spring came, the animals did not return, and the grove became on unsettling place. Drizzt fulfilled his promise to his dead friend, and set his face away from the grove to travel the world once again.</p><p>Over the next six years, Drizzt traveled from village to village, town to town, hoping the next one might take him in. His reception was always met with fear and prejudice which always turned to anger. Many times the dark elf had to defend himself against senseless violence towards him. Even after so many rejections, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar pressed on, believing in his heart that he would one day find acceptance, and with it a home. Unknown to Drizzt, however, his presence did not go unnoticed, making his passing the talk of the local taverns all over the region. In one such tavern, Roddy McGristle overheard the rumors, and learned of a purple-eyed drow moving from town to town. In a rage, he confronted Tephanis with his lie about the death of Drizzt, and killed the quickling for his treachery. The vengeful hunter set out on the road to find the drow once again.</p><p>During his travels, Drizzt fell in with a group called the Weeping Friars, a group of men who believed that there was only so much pain and suffering in the world, and that by taking hardships and pain upon themselves, they spared others from experiening the same. This group were homeless by choice, and made their way through life only by begging for the goodwill of others, and even then only taking the absolute minimum needed to stay alive. These friars accepted Drizzt, mostly thankful for the companionship of a skilled warrior along the road. After a week with the friars, Drizzt came to understand that his place was not with them, and he followed one of their number's advice to go north, to a place full of rogues called Ten-Towns.</p><h3>Icewind Dale: Glimpses of the Future</h3><p>Drizzt found himself on the road yet again, heading north towards the Spine of the World mountain range in the northwestern corner of Faerun. Skirting the narrow passage of land between the mountain range and the coast, he eventually made his way into the wide valley known as Icewind Dale. Originally settled by rogues with no where else to go centuries before, the Dale now boasted ten villages, collectively known as Ten-Towns. Each of the ten villages made their livelihood through fishing for the knucklehead trout which lived in abundance in the several lakes of the Dale. Good for food, the knucklehead troat was also the sole source of bone for the Dale's other well-known export, scrimshaw.</p><p>Dominating the landscape of the Dale is the sole mountain in the grand valley, a craggy peak known as Kelvin's Cairn. Many of the ten villages had been built with their back to the mountain, allowing it to form a natural barrier between the individual settlements, and forming a last resort of defense from the orc and giant hoards found in the northern reaches. Spring, summer and fall were extremely short seasons in the Dale, leaving the villages in a near constant winter. Drizzt arrives in the Dale and makes his way directly toward the largest settlement, Bryn Shander.</p><p>When he approaches the gates, the guards halt him as they would any other newcomer. After they discover he is a drow, they panic and one of them runs to get the town's spokesman. Cassius is not only the spokesman for the town of Bryn Shander, but he is also the principle spokesman of the Ten-Towns ruling council, making him the most powerful man in the Dale. He questions why Drizzt has come to their town, and then refuses Drizzt admittance, telling him to try one of the other, smaller towns. <strong><em>\"And when they refuse me entry where then, fair spokesman?\"</em></strong> Drizzt asks plainly. <strong><em>\"Out in the wind to die on the empty plain?\"</em></strong> After asking if Drizzt is good with his blades, he tells Drizzt that <strong><em>\"It would do Ten-Towns well to have a scout on the mountain's (Kelvin's Cairn) northern slopes.\"</em></strong> When Drizzt balks a bit at the offer, seeing it as only a way to get rid of the drow, Cassius replies, <strong><em>\"I offer you a hole in a plie of rock where your actions, good or bad, will become your reputation beyond the color of your skin. I offer you a chance to prove yourself worthy of a place here. I can do no more than that.\"</em></strong> To this, Drizzt agrees and accepts, trading his horse for supplies and making his way toward Kelvin's Cairn within the hour.</p><p>Down below the mass of Kelvin's Cairn, lies another unseen settlement, unknown to the casual observer. The Battlehammer clan of dwarves, in exile from their traditional home of Mithril Hall. Bruenor Battlehammer is ruler over the dwarves of Icewind Dale, and known for his stubbornness. Beneath his gruff exterior is a kind heart, as is proved by his taking in of the young the young fostering, Cattie-Brie. Cattie-Brie's parents had been killed during a gobllin raid when she was just a toddler, and Bruenor had shown a compassion uncommon among his kind, taking in a human. A few weeks after Drizzt arrives in the Dale, Cattie begs to be let outside, her human spirit stifled by halls meant for dwarven sensibilities. Against his better judgment, Bruenor acquiesces, and allows her to go out for a time.</p><p>Cattie goes outside, and quickly runs across Drizzt and his great panther. For the first time in years, Drizzt is not met with instant fear and prejudice. Though wary because of all the stories she had heard about drow, Cattie does not run away, but remains open with the curiosity of a child. Making instant friends with Guenhwyvar, Cattie-Brie speaks with Drizzt for a short time, and then runs back home before her father can get worried for her safety. Drizzt knew he had made a new friend, and he hoped that the friendship would open other doors as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bruenor himself had just learned of the presence of the drow elf from the spokesman of Bryn Shander, Cassius. Fearing for the safety of his daughter, Bruenor forbids Cattie from going out on the Cairn again without his express permission. She tries to tell Bruenor she had already met the elf and trusted him, but was unable to do so, and was cowed into promising him she would not go onto the mountain again. During an uncharacteristic mid-winter thaw, Cattie=Brie realizes she could keep her promise to Bruenor by staying on the paths that skirted Kelvin's Cairn, and then call out for Drizzt. Bruenor never told her not to contact the elf, just to stay off the Cairn. Every few weeks, Cattie would venture out of the dwarven caves, looking for her new friend. They passed the winter, their relationship growing ever more closer.</p><p>For his part, Bruenor had vowed to confront the dark elf as soon as the winter snows began to recede. He had never met a dark elf himself, but he knew their reputation, and would no longer suffer such a dangerous foe so close to home. While climbing the Cairn and looking for the drow, Bruenor is attacked by an ice worm, one of the huge dragon-like creatures that inhabit the Dale. Though he is initially caught by surprise and knocked down, Bruenor quickly gets the upper hand with his battle axe, cleaving the head of the beast cleanly. Up above, Drizzt is silently watching. When Bruenor sees him standing there, he calls out to Drizzt, calling him a vile creature. Disappointed in the dwarf after spending so much time with Cattie, Drizzt's initial reaction is to give in to his anger and allow the hunter to come and deal with the dwarven king. Drizzt's true nature, the individual Mielikki spoke to in his heart, won the day, and so Drizzt slowly turned and walked away. The dark elf's departure confused Bruenor, and flew in the face of all he had ever heard of the drow species. Bruenor convinced himself that the being must not be a drow after all.</p><p>A few weeks later, Drizzt's enemy, Roddy McGristle enters Icewind Dale. Somehow, he had been able to track Drizzt from Lurkwood all the way to Bryn Shander. From there, he was able to follow the clues to the throne room of Clan Battlehammer. Bruenor, still not believing he had encountered a drow, says he had not seen a dark elf. In addition, he states that, <strong><em>\"If yer drow's about, he's been no bother.\"</em></strong> McGristle goes into his usual diatribe about how Drizzt attacked and killed the Thistledown family, killed one of his dogs, and scarred his face. To these accusations, Cattie-Brie calls McGristle a liar, and then Bruenor throws the ugly human out of his Hall for upsetting his daughter. After Roddy is gone, Bruenor turns on his daughter and yells, <strong><em>\"Ye've been to the mountain and seen the drow, haven't ye? Ye've disobeyed me! And now we learn the dark elf's a killer!\"</em></strong></p><p>Disbeleiving the accusations, Cattie-Brie runs out into the winter snows to confront Drizzt, and tells him of Roddy and the rumors of the Thistledown family. <strong><em>\"So that story has followed me event to the end of the world.\"</em></strong> Drizzt is shocked, but not surprised, and as they discuss the situation further, Drizzt realizes that his troubles will not soon end. He sends Cattie-Brie home, telling her not to fear for his own safety. At that moment, Drizzt decides he has no wish to further battle Roddy, and so decides to leave Icewind Dale. As Cattie is headed home, she is assaulted by Roddy, who has followed her and seen her with Drizzt. He threatens her and tells her she will take him to Drizzt, but he drow appears behind him suddenly and says, <strong><em>\"Let the girl go, McGristle.\"</em></strong> After a brief, but heated exchange, Roddy lets Cattie go, and attacks Drizzt. Easily evading the brutish attack, Drizzt succeeds in knocking the hunter down, and has the man at his mercy. Instead of choosing to strike the bigot down, he slams his scimitar's pommels against Roddy's temples, knocking him unconscious. Drizzt leaves him lying in the snow. Hours later, Cattie-Brie brings Bruenor to where Roddy lay. He tells Roddy that he should not have touched Cattie, and furthermore should not caller her a liar. He takes a leg from the hunter's remaining dog as revenge. McGristle and his now three legged dog left the Dale and never returned, neither did he ever bother Drizzt again.</p><p>Bruenor then climbs Kelvin Cairn and finally meets Drizzt face to face. He tells the drow, <strong><em>\"All my life I been told drow are evil. But then one comes to my valley, and worse, me own daughter goes to him! She tells me he has a good heart, and I see in her eyes she's speakin' true, what then? I thought I knew, thought I had it all figured out, but I didn't know nothin'...but ye be keepin' yer eyes on me girl if she's so orc-headed as to keep visitin' ye! Be knowin' that I hold yerself responsible for her safety!\"</em></strong> Unsure at first what to make of the dwarf's tirade, Drizzt eventually realized that Bruenor had accepted him. The dark elf decided he would not leave Icewind Dale. After nearly two decade, Drizzt had finally come home.</p><h2>The Crystal Shard</h2><h3>The Dwarven Vale: Dark Protector</h3><p>Five years have passed since Drizzt came to Icewind Dale and accepted his position of lookout atop Kelvin's Cairn. He has been accepted by Bruenor Battlehammer and his foster-daughter Cattie-Brie, and that acceptance has given Drizzt the ability to walk freely down the streets of the villages of Ten-Towns. Though he is mistrusted still by many of the locals, they too have accepted his presence, though somewhat warily. Drizzt has found a home, and he would do everything necessary to protect it.</p><p>Life was hard in the frozen tundra north of the Spine of the World mountain range, and the only civilization evident were there the ten settlements, Lonelywood, Termaline, Caer Konig, Caer Dinival, Bremen, Targos, Easthaven, Dougan's Hole, Good Mead, and the largest, Bryn Shander. The local economy was dependent upon the abundant knucklehead trout found in cold lakes. Besides being the primary source of food for trade and their own tables, the head bones of the trout were carved into intricate designs by local scrimshanders. Just north of Ten-Towns, lay the Dwarven Vale, and the mines of Clan Battlehammer. Trade between the humans and the dwarves was an important feature of life in the Dale. Even further north, above the Reghed Glacier, lay the homes of the Barbarian tribes who viewed their neighbors to the south with contempt. From his perch at the top of Bruenor's Climb, Drizzt Do'urden looked down on it all.</p><p>Down in Bryn Shander, a group of wizards from the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan, Ten-Towns' chief trading partner, have come searching for some rare spell components found only in the icy north. The most powerful among them, Morkai the Red, is murdered by his apprentice Adar Kessell upon the prompting of the other two, Eldeluc and Dendybar the Mottled. Adar was an old apprentice, unable to become a wizard because he stuttered so badly he could only speak basic spells. He had been promised power by the other wizards, and so he had killed the only man who had taken pity on him during all his years in the Hosttower. Over on the lakeshore near Lonelywood, Regis lay soaking up the sun. He had originally come from come from the far south, the desert land of Calimshan. He had been a prominent member of the theives guild of Calimport, but a misunderstanding with his guildmaster Pasha Pook over a certain ruby pendant had forced him to leave in a hurry. Now living in Icewind Dale, beyond the reach of the arm of Pook, Regis felt he had finally found his place. He had taken up the art of scrimshaw, becoming one of the foremost scrimshanders in the Dale. He had also recently been elected as the spokesman for Lonelywood, the smallest of the Ten-Towns.</p><p>For his part, Drizzt still fought how the sunlight burned his eyes, even after so many years on the surface. The winter snows exaserbated the condition, but Drizzt would not let that deter him from protecting the Dale with all his heart, strength and skill. Among the duties he placed upon himself was the tracking down of the dangerous tundra yeti that roamed the snow drifts looking for local citizens to use as food. Drizzt did his best to thin the herd and keep the beasts away from the villages. On one particular day, while on his way to meet Bruenor, he is assaulted by two of the yeti, and only escapes certain death because of the timely intervention of the Battlehammer king. Unknown to the pair, Beorg and Heafstagg, clan chiefs of two the Barbarian tribes to the north, have called all the tribes together in preparation for a full scale assault on Ten-Towns.</p><p>Heafstagg was the leader of the Tribe of Elk, and only interested in personal glory. While most Barbarians held a deep seeded hatred of the Ten-Towns' residents, Heafstagg only hoped for battle for his own personal gain. The tribes planned to sweep donw on Ten-Towns, and kill them for their greed of hoarding the land and lakes, enslaving any who survive. Nearby meanwhile, Adar Kessell has been betrayed by his new masters, and left for dead in the deepening snow. As he desperately begins to search for shelter, he accidentally comes across one of the most powerful artifacts on the surface of Faerun, Crenshinibon, the Crystal Shard.</p><p>Crenshinibon, created by seven undead wizards, was an artifact of pure evil that was powered by the purest thing available, the light of the sun. Though the Crystal Shard would have been powerful, it was more than its creators could handle, and it sucked their souls into itself, adding their considerable powers to it own, and flinging the witnessing demon Ertuu back into his own realm, the Abyss. After a thousand years of lying unknown in the snow, Adar Kessell now became the willing pawn of the Shard, giving his entire life to the thing as long as he received the one thing he was looking for, respect. For the first time on the surface of Faerun, Crenshinibon raised a giant copy of itself, the crystal tower Cryshal-Tirith.</p><p>Drizzt and Bruenor arrive at the dwarf's throne room and begin discussing how to go about rediscovering Clan Battlehammer's ancestral home, Mithril Hall. Drizzt agrees that someday they will find it, but for now more pressing matters required their attention. Drizzt has seen the Barbarians moving southward banging their war drums. <strong><em>\"If Ten-Towns doesn't unite against them, the people are doomed.\"</em></strong> Bruenor sees that they will need his people's help to win the battle, but he refuses to do so if the towns remain divided. He will not throw away his people's lives in a futile effort. If necessary, he will seal the entrances to Clan Battlehammer's halls and wait for the bloodshed to be over.</p><p>Drizzt suggests that they get Regis to use both his position as spokesman of Lonelywood and his magic ruby pendant to bring the other nine spokesmen together for the defense of the people. Bryn Shander was the capitol of Ten-Towns, and so the Council gathered together. If Regis could get the two spokesmen of Targos and Termalaine to agree, the others would all fall in line. This was a near impossible task, as the two towns were the most prosperous of the area, and therefore fierce competitors. As the spokesmen on the Council argued among themselves and called one another liars, Regis stood up on the table to adress them. Though uncomfortable with using the ruby pendant in such a way, he knew that they survival of Ten-Towns was at stake, so he used the gem on Kemp of Targos, bringing him unwittingly into agreement with Agorwal of Termalaine. The alliance of Ten-Towns was assured, at least until after the battle was over. Soon, Drizzt began tracking the Barbarians as they moved out of the snow-covered passes and into the wider valled of the Dale. He reported back often on the tribes' progress, going directly to Cassius and the other spokesmen of the Council. Though Kemp and a few others still treated him with disdain, the others at least accepted him as an ally and a much needed resource if they were to keep tabs on events as they unfolded. As some of the villages are evacuated to Bryn Shander, Drizzt proposes a trap. A smaller group of Barbarians rush into the deserted town of Termalaine and are ambushed by a group of archers and warriors. It was a slaughter, the Barbarians falling dead to the ground before they could even brandish their weapons.</p><p>Meanwhile, the larger force of Barbarians surrounds Bryn Shander, believing the siege would be short lived. Caught between the combined armies of Ten-Towns inside the walls, and Bruenor's dwarven warriors combined with Bryn Shander's warriors on the outside, the northern tribes held no chance for survival. In the middle of it all were the blindingly fast blades of Drizzt, a seeming force of nature against which the Barbarians fled like frightened children. Until he was caught from behind with a mace to the ribs.</p><p>Nearby, Heafstagg finally realized that not a man of his would make it off the field of battle unless he called for retreat. As the Barbarians run from the battle, Bruenor is struck from behind with a wooden pole atop his head. He turns to see the culprit is a young boy, the standard-bearer of Heafstagg. <strong><em>\"Fool boy,\"</em></strong> he yells at the child, <strong><em>\"ain't ye never been told not to hit a dwarf in the head?\"</em></strong> He knocks the child unconscious with the back of his axe blade. Nearby, Drizzt meets with Heafstagg as he is running for his life. They engage in battle, and Drizzt is able to get a blade into the Barbarians shoulder, but is himself slowed by his earlier wound. Heafstagg backhands the drow, knocking him away. Heafstagg bears down on the dark elf, and the two of them trade blow after blow, until they both pass out from the blood loss. Heafstagg is carried away by his men while Drizzt is left for dead on the battlefield. Kemp, the councilor for Targos (whom Regis had bewitched with his ruby), and his men find Drizzt unconscious, and literally kick him while he's down. When about to strike a blow to kill Drizzt, Kemp is interrupted by by Agorwal, councilor from the rival town of Termaline. <strong><em>\"Were it not for the dark elf, Termaline would be in flames,\"</em></strong> Agorwal exclaims. <strong><em>\"Drizzt is under my protection now! And never again shall I, or my fellow men of Termaline, prejudge him by the color of his skin and the reputation of his kin!\"</em></strong> Kemp calls Agorwal a fool as the men of Termaline carry Drizzt from the field of battle. Across the battlefield, two men find the young boy who hit Bruenor on the head. Bruenor has his life spared, and asks his name. The boy replies, <strong><em>\"Wulfgar,</em></strong> and Bruenor informs him that he is now to be Bruenor's servant for the next five years. Over the next four and a half years, life in Icewind Dale returned to peaceful normalcy. No longer facing a common foe, the individual towns of the Dale returned to bickering over the rights of fishing the knucklehead trout. The dwarves retreated back into their underground lair, and Drizzt continued to watch over them all. Regis became even fatter as his personal riches grew. He had resorted to using the Ruby Pendant in his dealings with traders for his scrimshaw, \"persuading\" them to give him ten times their actual value for the carvings. Wulfgar, a boy no longer, having grown into a strapping young man, entered his fifth and final Spring in Bruenor's service. While he had been angry and bitter in his initial days, he eventually came to respect and love the surly dwarf like a father, and worked hard every day to please the old codger. Wulfgar had been given more freedom over the months and years, and had been taught smithcraft by the dwarven clan chief, becoming quite skilled at forging blades. In time, he came to see that he owed the dwarf a great debt for saving his life and making him a better man. The intervening years had been good to Adar Kessel as well. In his green crystal tower of Cryshal-Tirith, he had used the persuasive powers of Crenshinibon to amass a small army of ogres, orcs, and trolls, as well as create his own personal harem from the barbarian tribes of the north. Crenshinibon was always thirsting for power via conquest, and grew impatient at Adar's reticence to strike out at little more than caravans of traders, but eventually the army grew to over ten thousand, and Kessell was finally of a mind to make his name known to the world. Meanwhile, somewhere else in the world a young wizard had foolishly summoned the demon Errtu. Too powerful for the young wizard, Errtu snuffed out the man's life and broke the bonds of the binding circle, free to search after the Crystal Shard after the long millenia. At the same time, Bruenor embarks on a quest to create his greatest work. Bruenor's father had told him, <strong><em>\"If yer talent for the craft is keen, and ye're lucky enough to live long and feel the strength of the earth, ye'll find a special day. A special blessin'. For once, and only once, the very best of our smiths may craft a weapon of their choosing that outdoes any work they'd ever done. A weapon of legend.\"</em></strong> Today was Bruenor's day. Aegis-Fang was given shape. Aegis-Fang, a weapon of legend, of power, one that would \"change the course of history, and reshape all of Icewind Dale.\" During the long night of it's forging, Drizzt kept watch over the dwarf, never telling him he witnessed the birth of Bruenor's <em>magnum opus</em>. As a result, he missed the arrival of the giant demon Errtu in the environs of the Dale, as he crashed into Cryshal-Tirith, and confronted Adar Kessell. Though only a weak human, Errtu was no match for the man so long as Crenshinibon preferred the human over the demon, and was thus struck down before he could reach the man. Kessell essentially convinces Errtu to join forces with him, promising him that (since human life-span is short compared to a demon's) he could have the Crystal Shard when ever he had passed on. Errtu accepts the deal with relish.</p><h3>The Frozen North: An Unfulfilled Vow</h3><p>The days of his freedom nearing, Wulfgar spends more and more days contemplating the frozen lands of his people in the northern reaches of the Dale. Cattie-brie does her best to draw the young man out, but his stubborn pride and \"traditional\" view of women does not allow him to view her as the intelligent young woman she has truly become. Wulfgar mistakenly believes Cattie would not understand such things as the honor of a warrior, to which she replies, <strong><em>\"Do you think you hold honor in your oversized hands for no better reason than what you hold in your pants?\"</em></strong> She leaves the young man dazed and dumbfounded.</p><p>Later that night, Bruenor finally presents Wulfgar with two magnificent gifts, his freedom, and Aegis-Fang. From the moment Wulfgar hefted the hammer, it had been made for him, or better yet, he had been born of it by the gods. The only condition placed upon the gift, a vow which Wulfgar easily spoke, was that the great weapon never be raised against the people of Ten Towns. The next day, Bruenor introduces Wulfgar to his new instructor, the dark elf Drizzt Do'urden. The same prejudices Wulfgar held toward women were quickly exposed in the beginnings of his relationship with the drow.</p><p>In the secret reaches of the Dale, Adar Kessell and Errtu launch their plans for conquest, sending the ice giant Biggrin to set up and advance scouting camp near Ten Towns. Errtu does not thing the course of action wise, sending a giant so close to a primarily human community, be Adar (blinded by his power through Crenshinibon) believes otherwise. Errtu points out that even the Crystal Shard advised otherwise, but Adar screams <strong><em>\"Crenshinibon advises, but I decide!\"</em></strong> Errtu relents, stepping back and biding his time for an opportunity. At that moment, the latest additions to Kessell's growing army finally arrive, the Barbarian tribes under the leadership of Heafstagg. The great warrior hates Kessell and hates what he has become, but like so many others has been unable to resists the call of the Shard. Heafstagg comes before the throne of Kessell, and bows in fealty to the hated man. The next morning, Wulfgar starts his training with Drizzt. On first sight of the drow, Wulfgar growls at Bruenor, <strong><em>\"This is my teacher? My people are bred a true warriors! What can I learn of fighting from a weakling elf?\"</em></strong> To this, Drizzt promptly and easily ducks Wulfgar's first swipe from Aegis-Fang, and kicks the much larger man in the face. <strong><em>\"Give me a few weeks,\"</em></strong> is the drow's simple reply. Drizzt's first order is to toughen the lad up even more by ordering him to hunt for their food during the day while he himself rested in his cave. At night, they fought long and hard, Drizzt never letting up and slapping Wulfgar at every opening in his defenses with the flat of his scimitar's blades. Being defeated so easily only made Wulfgar's anger grow, and anger which put the Barbarian at a disadvantage, since he would quickly lose his head in such cases. While physically stronger than nearly any normal man, Drizzt soon began to teach Wulfgar that control of oneself could faster bring control of one's weapons skill.</p><p>Wulfgar quickly swallowed his pride and learned all he could from this adept drow warrior. He came to appreciate this quiet elf's sense of honor and dignity. By the end of the second week, the barbarian was in complete control of his great hammer, and could successfully block most of the elf's scimitar thrusts. He came to recognize not only his weak and open areas, but learned how to counter-strike after a successful parry. Soon, Drizzt was confident the man could fell a giant in a single blow, if only he could learn patience.</p><p>One of the final lessons taught by Drizzt during their days alone together takes place one night while Wulfgar looks down over the campfires of his people out on the plains. He is told by Drizzt that they have rebounded from their defeat at the hands of Ten Towns, and they are once again masters of the plain. When Wulfgar inquires about Heafstagg, king of his tribe--the tribe of Elk--Drizzt explains that he no longer kin of the Elk tribe, but now rules over all the tribes. Wulfgar mentions how mighty a king Heafstagg is, and Drizzt counters by saying, <strong><em>\"No, he's a savage fighter.\"</em></strong> When questioned, Drizzt explains that a king is a man of character who leads by example and truly cares for his people, not a dictator who rules only because he is the strongest. Wulfgar is left alone to ponder those thoughts. That very night, as two of Biggrin's giants are making their way back to their cave, they come across two dwarves sitting at their campfire. Though ordered to stay away from all Icewind Dale residents and definitely not kill any, the pair attack the dwarves, slaughtering them in their surprise. Stupidly, they drag the corpses to a nearby tree, thinking they have hidden their crime by stuffing the bodies into a wide bole, but little escapes the eyes of the Dale's dark protector.</p><p>Later that night, as Drizzt and Wulfgar are running around the perimeter of the Dale, the big man questioned the dark elf's very presence in the cold north. Why was a creature of such skill and impeccible morality in such a place? And above all, why did he leave his people? Drizzt responds, <strong><em>\"They kill without mercy. They kill without passion. Lolth, the demon goddess they serve, feeds on treachery and violence--leaving no room for anything else. That's why I'm here.\"</em></strong> When Wulfgar counters that he'll never see his people or his family again, Drizzt says that he has his own respect, and that is enough, leading Wulfgar to whisper to himself, <strong><em>\"Perhaps we are not so different.\"</em></strong></p><p>Drizzt halts their patrol when he smells the scent of fresh blood nearby. They run to see the bodies of the dwarves, Bundo and Dourgas, stuffed in the tree. Drizzt easily sees the giant footprints in the dirt, and deduces they are part of a much larger force. He send Wulfgar back to warn Bruenor and the others, promising, <strong><em>\"I won't start the fun without you.'</em></strong> Wulfgar ran all through the night, pushing himself to his peak to warn Bruenor to rouse the clan. Then, he turned back around without resting and ran back north to where he left Drizzt, eager to finally put Aegis-Fang to good use.</p><p>Being large, incredibly stupid creatures, Drizzt found the giants very easily. Incongruously, Drizzt found the giants had planned and made an encampment which should have been far too complex for the brutes. When Wulfgar arrives, Drizzt calls Guenhwyvar, and the three of them infiltrate the giant's lair. Wulfgar had never seen the great black cat before, and is mistrustful of magic. He soon learns the panther's worth as she single-handedly takes down the first giant foe.</p><p>Bruenor and his dwarves, meanwhile, are slowly but steadily marching, following the directions provided by Wulfgar. An advance scout reports sighting a large group of giants and ogres ahead, but Bruenor realizes they are not yet near the place Wulfgar indicated the giant's camp lay. Bruenor and his men set a trap for the advancing reinforcements and laid in wait, slaughtering nearly all the ogres and many of the giants with their arrows. The dwarves descended upon the dazed and panicked giants, killing them swifly and not allowing a single foe to escape. The battle, in the place known as Daledrop, was over in three minutes. Meanwhile, Drizzt and his companions have snuck into the giant's kitchen, and ambush a giant as he enters, killing him instantly. All hell breaks loose as the three cut a swath through the giants and ogres, felling one after another with claws, blades and hammer. For all their prowess, the trio was outnumbered, and Drizzt, being the focus of the giant's ire, was soon to be overwhelmed. Wulfgar throws his hammer for the first time, purely on instinct, smashing the head of one of the giants attacking Drizzt. Now unarmed, another giant bore down on the defenseless barbarian, only to witness the great battlehammer magically re-materialize in the warrior's hand. Wulfgar backhands his attacker, sending the last giant in the room to the floor, leaving the trio momentarily victorious.</p><p>Bruenor, having kept one of the ogres from the battle of Daledrop alive, gets Regis to use his Ruby Pendant on the creature. They learn that all of the orc, goblin, ogre, giant and barbarian tribes have united under the banner of Adar Kessell, and they plan to shortly attack Ten Towns. Wulfgar is enraged, believing his people would never band with such creatures, but he and the others know the power of Regis' jewel, it cannot be lied to. Regis goes to Bryn Shander to warn the council, a task which takes several days since the leaders are all loath to leave their own cities again.</p><p>Spokesman Kemp, as usual, mistrusts the word of the dwarves, especially since they ally themselves with Drizzt. Even more, he feels them stupid for relying on the word of an ogre, eventually accusing Agorwal of concocting the plan so that he could draw the citizens of Targos away from their fishing so that Termaline's fishers could freely fish alone. Cassius calls on Regis to \"persuade\" Kemp, to which the Termaline spokesman balks, stating that Regis has some sort of magic about him which allows him to sway those to whom he speaks. At this, the unswayed members of the council grow suspicious of Regis, causing Bruenor to storm out of the council chambers, leaving the human settlements to fend for themselves.</p><p>After Bruenor storms out of the meeting with the human settlements, he talks with Drizzt and Wulfgar. He tells them he plans to close the mines and wants them to go with him. Wulfgar tells him no and that he has other buisness he has to take care off. Drizzt intrigued by this follows Wulfgar across the frozen tundra. Drizzt then followed his friend into a icey cave where the mighty Iceingdeath slept.</p><p>Drizzt and Wulfgar battle the ancient white dragon. Seeing a large icey stalagtite above Iceingdeath Wulfgar threw his magical wahammer Aegis-Fang to dislodge it. The frozed spear struck down upon the dragon slaying it where it stood. Together they claimed its treasure horde. Drizzt told him he did not need any gold, but would take the Iceingdeath scimitar that lay amongst the treasures. With that they split thier ways, Drizzt returning to the human settlemnts and Wulfgar heading back to his tribeman.</p><p>The monstous army now surronded the city of Bryn Shander, and a evil demon summoned forth a large green tower. There Akar Kessel demanded the citys loyalty after showing a taste of his power in destroying the city of Targos.</p><p>Seeing the demon Drizzt put together a plan where he would hope to learn information. Summoning the demon Errtu Drizzt used his heritage to gain information. But the demon learned he was being stricked and attacked. Drizzt fought the demon along side Guenwhyvar. The scimitar he had taken from the dragons horde came alive when facing the demon. It struck against his blade hard and engulfed him in ice. Drizzt stabs him with Iceingdeath, defeating the demon by banishing him from the physical plane, but not before it issued a threat to him. In that thread he told him in 100 years he would be free again, and he would have his revenge.</p><p>Regis was sent to be the spokesman in Akar's green crystal tower. There he tried to charm him with his mgical gem. But it did not work, meanwhile Drizzt was sneaking into the tower. He reached the room where Regis and Akar were. Regis warned Drizzt of the towers power source and he went about to destroy it. With one strike from his new sword it shattered. In a last ditch effort Akar did a spell teleporting him and Drizzt out of the crumbling tower.</p><p>During this the armies of the Ten Towns united along side the Dwarves of Clan Battlehammer once more and defeated Akar's goblinoid army. Regis was shown amongst the ruins of the crystal tower and proclaimed Wizard Slayer.</p><p>Now on the mountain ledge Drizzt and Akar battled it out. Foolishly Akar shot forth a green bolt of lightning which Drizzt dodged. Knowing an avalance was coming he kept running leaving Akar to die in a snowy tomb. With the goblin army defeated and Akar slain the people of Ten Towns made a new alliance. One that now involved the Dwarves of Battlehammer, and the Barbarians of the Tundra.</p><p>Bruenor pretends to be on his death bed when Drizzt comes to visit him. Useing Wulfgar and Catti-brie they trick him into agreeing to go out and find Mithral Hall. With Drizzt vowing on his word Bruenor shot out of bed happy and well. When spring came Bruenor, Drizzt, Wulfgar, and Regis all st out to find the lost dwarven city of Mithral Hall.</p><h2>Streams Of Silver</h2><p>The four companions set out from Icewind Dale. Bruenor to find his lost home of Mithral Hall. Wulfgar was a young man set out in the world for the first time. Drizzt who was on yet another adventure that would span his ling life. Regis who seemed at odds with the road. More comfortable with sleeping an eating than traveling. It seemed more like he was running from something, than looking for something. Thier march south took them two weeks before they reached the gates of Luskan, the City of Sails.</p><p>Meanwhile back at Bryn Shander a cloaked man by the name of Artemis Entreri entered Regis's obandoned house. Searching for clues he knew Regis had left in a hurry. Then a couple of dwarves and and a young girl entered the home. From the shadows he attacked killing the dwarves effortlessly. The girl Catti-brie adopted daughter of Bruenor ran in fear. She was stopped by the man who threatned her for information. The man unerved her more than anything in her life as she told him they were headed for Luskan. With that Artemis left her to cry in her own fear.</p><p>The four companions were allowed entry into Luskan for Regis's fame of crafting Scrimshaw. Inside they headed for the docks district. Bruenor and Drizzt would leave Wulfgar and Regis at the Cutless while they went to gather thier information here. Drizzt gave Wulfgar a warning to keep care of Regis and to beware the woman. With that they left them to and headed off into the night.</p><p>While Driizzt and Bruenor were gone a fight broke out in the bar. One that Wulfgar eaily won. But with that they were kicked out to wait for thier companions on the door step. While that was going on Drizzt and Bruenor meet with a person named Whisper. They were told she would be able to get them a map of the region...for a price. When she returned with the map she asked for more money and then sprang a trap. Drizzt and Bruenor easily defeated the thugs and made thier way back with the map in tow. The friends decided it was not safe to stay in Luskan for them so they hopped the wall and made thier way into the wilderness to begin thier journey once more.</p><p>That next morning Catti-brie set out with a caravan headed for Luskan. She would find her friends and warn them of the dark man who was trailing them.</p><p>The next night the companions ran into a goblin party. During the fighting some barbarians of the Sky Ponies arrived to help take out the golbins, but then took Wulfgar, Regis, and Bruenor as captives. Drizzt escaped into the night, where he would make a plan to rescue his friends.</p><p>Back at the Tribes camp Wulfgar was set in a challenge of strength against that clans strongest warrior. At the time Wulfgar won the challenge Drizzt came riding in with the groups horses. The companies manage to escape with a brief fight, but were soon followed by a magical beast. The tribes Shaman had transformed thier best warrior into a etheral pegusus. Physical attacks were useless against it until Drizzt used Guenhwyvar to travel to the astral plane. Her home and the plane the ehteral beast would be on. Together they attacked the beast and forced it into the material plane where Wulfgar was waiting to deal the final blow.</p><p>The caravan Catti-brie was on set up for camp that night, and during that night Artemis saw thier fire in the distance. Curious he went to check it out, and saw the girl who he had gotten information from the day before. Silently he killed the caravaners and took Catti-brie hostage. On thier way to Luskan they were meet by a Guard named Jierdan. He told Artemis that his master wished to see him. After learning they knew of Regis, Drizzt, Wulfar, and Bruenor Artemis agreed. There he meet Dendybar a wizard of the Host Tower.</p><p>After another day of travel the group made it to Longsaddle, where they would visit the Ivory Mansion home to the wizards known as the Harpells. There they hoped to gain more knowledge on thier quest to find Mithral Hall. There they meet Harkel Harpell who would show them around. The place was full of magic and wonder, setting Wulfgar uneased. As the barbarin did not trust sorcery. In exchange for some information they wanted Drizzt agreed to tell the Harpells about his home city of Menzobarranzan. Thier they leared some information, but not enough to give them a heading. The next morning after a long needed peacful rest they headed out for Silverymoon.</p><p>Back in Luskan Harkel Harpel used magic to talk with Sydney a girl he crushed on. She was in fact the apprentice to Dendybar and learned that the dark elf was there in Longsaddle but headed out for Silverymoon in the morning.</p><p>This same night Artemis paid Whisper a visit to learn what he would about he encounter with the dark elf, and were they were headed. He learned they had gotten a map of the northland from her before he killed her. Back at the Host Tower an alliance was made. Artemis, the guard Jierdan, Dendybar's apprentice Sydney, and a Golem named Bok would set out in the morning for Silverymoon on magically speed horses where they would meet thier prey.</p><p>On thier travel from Longsaddle the weather turned worse. A thunderstorm moved in and they had to find cover. Once the storm cleared thier horse were gone, one was blasted by lightning and the others ran off. On foot they once again started thier journey. Five days brought them to the river Rauvin, and that night they heard a scream. Some riders were under attack and they went to thier aid. Once the creatures were defeated the riders yelled for them to stay back. They told Breunor he had foul company in the dark elf and to stay clear of the city Nesme. If they could not go through Nesme to get to Silverymoon, then they would have to pass through the Troll Moors.</p><p>Thier first night out of Luskan Catti-brie began to set a trap herself. She would try and create tension between Jierden and Artemis, hoping to get a chance to escape. During that same time Artemis spoke with Sydney asking about the Golem. She thought it had been sent to keep Aretmis in line. But Entreri warned her it was sent to watch her, and to make sure she did not try and claim what her master wanted. Two more days of travel and they made it to Silverymoon.</p><p>Back in the Trool Moors Drizzt and friends were attacked by Trolls. Cutting them up did nothing as it would simply create yet another one. They needed fire to keep them from regenerating. Grabbing torches they fought the trolls back, but the lights of the fire brought more trolls to them. They had to escape and fought with fire and steel throughout the night. The troll onslaught not stopping they had to run, and by next day break they were back at the river Rauvin, but not safe. A large river mosnter attacked and swallowed Regis as he went to get water. Thier blades were not enough to penetrate its scales. So Wulfgar used Aegis-fang to and his incredible strength to blast a hole into the beast killing it and releasing Regis. They used the creatures scales to make a raft to cross the river. Within the next few days they finally approched Silverymoon.</p><p>There at the gates of Silverymoon they were turned back. Not allowed into the city because of Drizzt's heritage. Frustrated they set back out. That night Drizzt could not sleep. Not being allowed into the city pained him. The place was known was acceptance ye the was not allowed in, was not accepted. Then an enchanting woman appeared before Drizzt. She told Drizzt she was Alustriel High Lady of Silverymoon. She wanted to let him know why she could not allow him entrance into her city. For the fear or wars and secret alliances she could not yet allow him to enter the city. She told him that she knew who he and his companions were, and why they came to Silerymoon. They sought the Vault of Sages for information that would lead them to Mithral Hall. She told him that she searched the vault herself and could not find much. She told Drizzt that there might be one more who could help him. Less than a days march was Heralds Holdfast, there lived the sage Old Night. He might be able to help them no thier journey. Before she left she gave Drizzt a potion of Remembrance. She said to give it to the dwarf when the answers you seek are near.</p><p>With little explanation the Companions of the Hall (a name coined by Harkel Harpell for the group) set out for Herlads Holfast. Drizzt once again with faith in himself, and in others. On the outside Heralds Holdfast lookded in ruins, but on the inside it was simply breath taking. Tapestrys, armors, weapons, books were everywhere. There they meet Old Night who had expected thier arrival because of Alustriel. He had searched his books and nly found one that held any referance to Mithral Hall. It spoke of an above ground city named Settlestone, and name Bruenor recognized immidetly. Drinking the potion Drizzt had given him he was flooded with memories of old. Once the potion took effect Bruenor knew where to go, and they headed out for fourtpeak.</p><p>Artemis and his group had waited for more than a week in Silverymoon with no signs of Drizzt or any of the others. They were giving up hope until the Golem Bok spoke \"Drow\" Smashing through walls it began its chace, for it was magically inspelled to track the drow once they were close enough. Artemis and the others had finally caught up to the Companions of the Hall. Artemis ordered for Jierdan to stay with Catti-brie while he went to capture Regis. Then Catti-brie's plan took effect. She had been egdeing those two into a fight since they left Luskan, and now it was happening. During the struggle she used a branch to strike Sydney on the head and made her way down the cliff to join her friends and warn them of Artemis and the others.</p><p>She reached them as they opened the door to Mithral Hall and warned them of thier puersuers. Not knowing anything about thier enemy they headed into Mithral Hall where they might be able to better fight them. Closing the magically sealed door behind them.</p><p>Inside the Hall it was lit with everburning torches. Inside they found the bodies of dwarves and duergar(gray dwarves). Amongst the bodies Bruenor saw his Bangor his father, and Garumn his fathers father. Wanting to avenge his clan and to claim his title Bruenor grabbed his fathers axe and armor. Then proclaimed himself Eighth King Of Mithal Hall. They then moved farther down into the halls</p><p>Doors didn't stop the Golem Bok from entering. He busted the door in allowing for the others to enter, and once again start thier search for the dark elf and Regis. They would come upon them at Garum's Gorge. Artemis came upon Drizzt with sword and dagger. Together they fought weaving and parrying, countering and striking. Both were master swordsman but that would not help them as the Stone work trap set off, collapsing under them. Both being lost into the darkness. During the trap each group was blocked off from each other by a cave in.</p><p>Bruenor began yelling at Regis blaming him for Drizzt's death, for being a thief. He makes mistake and his friends have to pay for them with thier lives. During this Catti-brie found a Quiver and Bow in the room they were in. The runes on the mantle translated from dwarven as \"Taulmaril the Hearseeker, and quiver of Anariel dwarf friend\". She then let loose an arrow over Brunor and Regis's head, ending thier arguement. She quickly reminded them of thier situation.</p><p>Elsewhere the uncounscious Drizzt was awakening to find a dagger at his throat. Artemis spoke of making a deal with Drizzt so that they could both make it out of the Halls alive. Agreeing they set out, and Drizzt realized his pouch was missing and that it must of fallen and been buried in the ton of earth. Passing through the mines the ran across rivers of silver, pure mithral a King's Hoard. There they they would fight together aganst the dozens of Duergar. Back to back they fought in pefect harmony. One of grace and one of fury, so alike yet so very differant.</p><p>The fighting had wanred the gray drawves, and they went to awaken thier master Shimmergloom. A shadow dragon and current ruler of Mithral Hall.</p><p>Brunor and the others would also face off against the gray dwarves. Fiercely they fought bow, hammer, and axe as Regis hide, only to be found by Sydney and magically webbed, holding him still. Wulfgar would then face off against the Golem. With sheer strength he ripped its head off and then pounded it over the cluff with his magical hammer. Meanwhile Catti-brie would come to Regis's rescue sending an arrow straight through the head of Sydney, from ear to ear. With that kill Catti-brie felt as if she had lost her innocence.</p><p>Then Shimmergloom flew out of the gorge, letting loose its breath weapon of darkness upon Wulfgar and Cattir-brie. Brunor searched for a way to help, and grabbing a berral of oil he leaped onto the drgaons back with a torch in his other hand. Smashing the barrel and lighting the dragon on fire he rode him down into the darkness, to the bottom of the gorge.</p><p>Drizzt and Artemis had made thier way out of the mines at this time. Striking Drizzt from behind Artemis took off. Drizzt would then come upon his friends Wulfgar and Catti-brie, but no Regis, and no Bruenor. Then fro acros the gorge Artemis called out \"Too late black elf the gem and halfing are mine\". Drizzt tried to reason with the assassin saying he did not need the halfing. Artemis told him the road to Calimport is long maybe he shall catch him before that, and if he will not come for the halfling then come for this. As he held out the figureine of Guenhwyvar and slipped away ito the darkness.</p><p>Later they would find thier way out of Mithral Hall. They journeyed back to Longsaddle where they would slit up once again. Wulfgar and Drizzt would go after Regis and hunt down the assassin, while Catti-brie would remain behind at Ivy Mansion to mass an army to retake Mithral Hall. Later, in Mithral Hall, Dendybar takes notice of Bok's corpse laying on the floor, amazed at the fact that it was defeated. He attempts to question Morkai about Drizzt's location, but the spirit refuses his inquiry. Just after banishing Morkai, Dendybar reanimates Bok. But, the golem is suddenly possessed by Morkai, taking advantage of the wizard's weakened body and crushing his skull with one hand.</p><h2>The Halfling's Gem</h2><p>Drizzt and Wulfgar finally approached and enter the Tower of Twilight upon welcome from wizard Malchor Harpell. As gifts, Drizzt received Twinkle, another enchanted scimitar to complement Iceingdeath, and enchanted horseshoes to increase the speed their horses. Malchor informs them that Calimport is about 2000 miles away from Longsaddle, and that they would need a ship to get there in a timely manner. Drizzt's race, however, would be a problem, but he says that there's a mask in Neverwinter Wood that can conceal his true appearance for that of a surface elf. Agatha, the banshee would be an obstacle. Regardless, Drizzt and Wulfgar set out for the mask.</p><p>Meanwhile, out at sea, Regis beckons to Artemis that the gem from he stole Pasha Pook overcame him, and that he had no choice but to take it. In spite of that, Artemis reminded Regis of his fate at the hands of Pasha Pook before he left him in his quarters. On the ship's deck, Artemis contemplated on his impasse battle with Drizzt, longing for a chance to defeat him in battle. In the morning that followed, Regis intentionally burned his forearm in multiple areas to pass off as if he contracted a flesh-eating disease in an attempt to scare the ship's crew. Although Artemis knew it was a trick, the crew didn't think so. As a result, the captain only offered to sail them to Baldur's Gate. Artemis reluctantly accepted, in exchange for the gold he paid, just before punishing Regis and killing the captain to keep the crew's mouths closed. Upon arrival, Artemis found another ship and left the harbormaster with a gift for a friend.</p><p>Drizzt and Wulfgar arrived at Neverwinter Wood, preparing themselves for Agatha's scream of death by wrapping up their ears. As they set foot in her lair, they are immediately ambushed by her. Drizzt leaves Wulfgar to engage her in battle as he searches for the mask. Upon finding it, the two of them flee and mount their horses for Waterdeep. The mask served its purpose, disguising Drizzt as a surface elf as they walk through town sans any racial slurs toward his Drow heritage. There, they met Captain Deudermont, a friend of Malchor's who agrees to take them south on his ship, the Sea Sprite.</p><p>Back at Mithral Hall, it is revealed that Bruenor survived his fall as Shimmergloom fell to its death weeks prior and had been climbing through the caverns, killing any Duergar that stand in his way. His trek brought him to Undercity, which was inhabited by thousands of gray dwarves. As he charged through the city, he slew several Duergar in his way as he ran for the city's furnace. There, he climbed to the top of it, protected from the heat and flames by his father's armor. He escaped through a chimney that was connected to the furnace, on the surface. He immediately fell asleep from exhaustion.</p><p>Drizzt and Wulfgar arrived in Baldur's Gate less a week later, and they are greeted by the harbormaster, who gives them the 'gift' that Artemis left for them. In the box was one of Regis's fingers.</p><p>Bruenor awakens ten days after his escape from Mithral Hall, only to be greeted by Alustriel of Silverymoon. She informed him that the rest of the Companions of the Hall are safe. Shorty, they depart for Longsaddle in her flaming chariot to reunite him with Cattie-Brie. From her, he is informed of Artemis taking Regis, and that Drizzt and Wulfgar are chasing him. He also learns that Cattie-Brie amassed an army of 100 Battlehammer soldiers and 8000 other soliders from Citadel Adbar in preparation of taking back Mithral Hall from the Duergar.</p><p>At Calimport, Pasha Pook is informed that Artemis has captured Regis and is a week away from arrival.</p><h2>Equipment of Drizzt Do'Urden</h2><p>Iceingdeath; A magical scimitar taken from the treasure hoard of the white dragon Iceingdeath. It has the ability to deal additional cold damage upon its strikes, and protects its wielder from fire. The blade has also proven to severely wound demons.</p><p>Twinkle; Was a gift from Malachor Harpell. This magical scimitar has a keen edge and glows when danger is near. It also has the ability to help improve the wielders defense.</p><p>Mithral Chain; This chain shirt was given to Drizzt by his dwarf friend King Bruenor Battlehammer.</p><p>Spider Silk Shirt; This dark lightweight shirt i magically enchanted to help protect him from slashing attacks. Almost neglecting the cuts completely.</p><p>Bracers of Blinding Strike; Taken from Dantrag the Weapons Master of House Baenre, they increase the wearers speed. Drizzt has chosen to wear them round his ankels instead.</p><h2>Other Apperances and Media</h2><p>Drizzt has appeared twice in Wizards of the Coast Dungeons and Dragons minatures. Each with a differant pose. The first one was in thier third set, while the second one was part of the Icon Box which contained Drizzt, Wulfgar, and Iceingdeath.</p><p>Replica's of his swords Iceingdeath and Twinkle have been crafted and are for sell.</p><h2>Video Game Appearances</h2><p>Drizzt Do'urden appears an an unlockable playable character in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Dark Alliance II for Playstation 2 and X-Box. To unlock him, all you have to do is beat the game on normal difficulty. Dark Alliance II also features Artemis Entreri as an unlockable character.</p><p>Drizzt is a somewhat important character in Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone. He is voiced by <a href=\"http://imdb.com/name/nm0235960\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin Downes</a>.</p><p>Drizzt appears in Baldur's Gate 2 for PC, and if you have an evil character with the same name, he will attack you for dirtying his reputation. If you kill him and the Champions, you can loot them, but all the items disappear later. He is also featured as part of a puzzle later in the game.</p>",

    "deck": "Belwar Dissengulp is a member of the deep gnome race, and one of the first among Faerun's races to place trust in the drow Drizzt Do'urden. Drizzt once spared his life, and Belwar returns the favor.",
    "description": "<br/><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Burrow-Warden</p><p>=================</p><p>Belwar is one of the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43565\" href=\"/svirfnebli/4015-43565/\" slug=\"svirfnebli\">Svirfnebli</a>, a race of deep gnomes who dwell in the Underdark city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43553\" href=\"/blingenstone/4020-43553/\" slug=\"blingenstone\">Blingenstone</a>. He had served for many years as a burrow-warden, a mining expedition leader in the Blingenstone system of exploration and expansion. During one of these many expeditions, Belwar's group is set upon by a patrol of drow, and Belwar has his first encounter with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43472\" href=\"/drizzt-dourden/4005-43472/\" slug=\"drizzt-dourden\">Drizzt Do'urden</a>.</p><p>Drizzt's patrol takes them just five miles outside of the city of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43493\" href=\"/menzoberranzan/4020-43493/\" slug=\"menzoberranzan\">Menzoberranzan</a>, where they encounter Belwar's crew, deep gnomes on a mining expedition. Drow and deep gnomes were mortal enemies, and such an encounter could only end in bloodshed. Drizzt tries to dissuade his brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43474\" href=\"/dinin-dourden/4005-43474/\" slug=\"dinin-dourden\">Dinin Do'urden</a> from attacking, even to the point of suggesting parley, but he is rebuked in typical drow fashion. Dinin orders the attack, commanding them to go after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a> first, stating, <b><i>\"He is the key to their strength with the stone.\"</i></b> They rush into the gnomes, taking down the non-working scouts first, then heading for the crew leader. The drow are outnumbered but ruthless, giving out much more damage than they took. This prompts Belwar to grab a jewel and slam it to the ground, creating an earth elemental and commanding it to attack the drow. Drizzt races to the attack, but is struck down. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43476\" href=\"/guenhwyvar/4005-43476/\" slug=\"guenhwyvar\">Guenhwyvar</a>, against his master <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43481\" href=\"/masoj-hunett/4005-43481/\" slug=\"masoj-hunett\">Masoj Hun'ett</a>'s wishes, rushes in to defend Drizzt and is gravely injured, but buys him the time he needs to recover.</p><p>As Drizzt climbs up to the creature's head and is about to strike a killing blow, Masoj sends a bolt of lightning into them, hoping to kill both the elemental and Drizzt, making it appear to be an accident. Masoj is then clubbed in the back of the head by Belwar, who then moves on Drizzt. Drizzt tells him to go ahead and torture him, but the Belwar tells him that is not their way. They capture the Belwar, and Dinin orders him killed. As the priestess of Lolth moves forward to torture the him, Drizzt convinces them to allow him to live and go back home to tell the other Svirfnebli of the superiority of drow strength. Dinin likes the idea, but not before the take the gnome leader's hands first. Dinin says, <b><i>\"I want to hear his screams.\"</i></b> Belwar loses his hands, and is sent back to Blingenstone in disgrace.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Most Honored Burrow-Warden</p><p>==============================</p><p>After his treatment at the hands of the drow, Belwar is given the title of <i>Most Honored Burrow-Warden</i>, something he does not believe he deserves, and retires into a life of solitude. Some ten years later, his past comes back to change his future.</p><p>Drizzt Do'urden has rejected his people and their lifestyle, and has been living in the Underdark with Guenhwyvar as his only companion. After being discovered in his cavern home by his brother and sister, he decides he must take a new course.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Reunited with Drizzt</p><p>======================</p> Drizzt puts himself on the move again, knowing he cannot live in his beloved cavern is no longer secret, no longer safe. He runs through the tunnels, into twists and turns which he had never seen before until he ran directly into his past. At the end of his last stretch was a bright light (at least bright for the Underdark), he had come upon a gnome mining expedition. Drizzt follows them for days, hanging back in the shadows, listening to them longingly. They possessed something he himself had never experienced, camaraderie. He was drawn to their voices, their laughter, their smiles, believing he might go mad and totally loose himself in The Hunter if lost track of them. Eventually, their journey ended. He had come to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43553\" href=\"/blingenstone/4020-43553/\" slug=\"blingenstone\">Blingenstone</a>, the great fortress city of the Svirfnebli.<p>Drizzt makes an on the spot decision, and pulls Guen's figurine from his pocket and calls her to him. He says goodbye to her, stating he can no longer live out in the Underdark alone, and turns himself in to the gnomes at the gates of Blingenstone. He knows they will most likely kill him, his people and the deep gnomes were natural enemies, and might attack him on sight. Drizzt was not afraid, the fate of death at the hands of goodly people was better than the horrible isolation of the Underdark. He kept walking toward their gates and hoped and trusted for the best.</p> Members of the Blingenstone city council investigate Drizzt. They are naturally suspicious of him and his reasons for being in the city. Incredulous, they cannot believe that he has not only given himself up, but also the figurine of Guenhwyvarâa very powerful magical item not to be given up lightly. All the while Drizzt sat before them in chains, the Hunter inside him railed to be free, every moment heightening the rage and hunger to be free. Drizzt remained in control, keeping his composure before these wizened souls who held his life in their hands. They believe him a spy, and though he claims to be a renegade, they do not believe him since his House not only still exists, but has risen in stature in recent days. He replies that he is <b><i>\"rogue by choice,\"</i></b> and that he has nowhere else to go. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43555\" href=\"/firble/4005-43555/\" slug=\"firble\">Firble</a>, the gnome king's chief counselor and head of their spy network warns, <b><i>\"Our king will rule upon your fate, dark elf. And though I believe you and shall ask for mercy, I suspect you will be executed.\"</i></b><p>As Firble and the others are making their way out of his holding cell, Drizzt recalls the burrow warden he had convinced his brother to let go all those years before. He tells the gnome that he was part of that hunting party, and that one did survive, losing his hands in the battle. Firble names the burrow warden as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a>, stating that none of the citizens of Blingenstone would ever forget that dark day. Drizzt begs for Firble to bring Belwar Dissengulp, and he is left alone in the darkness.</p> Some time later, the burrow warden does come to see the captive drow, exclaiming, <b><i>\"Magga cammara it is you!\"</i></b> Belwar remembers Drizzt as the purple eyed drow that had bested his earth elemental and convinced his hunting party to take his hands rather than his life. Drizzt hangs his head in abject sorrow for what his people had done, but Belwar wants to hear nothing of it. <b><i>\"Bah!\"</i></b> the honored burrow warden exclaims, <b><i>\"Your words spared me that day, and I've not forgotten it. Besides, I have new hands now.\"</i></b> Belwar lifts up his arms, showing Drizzt an exquisite set of stone mason's tools, a hammer and pick axe, in place of hands.       Belwar informs Drizzt that it was the decision of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43554\" href=\"/king-schnicktick/4005-43554/\" slug=\"king-schnicktick\">King Schnicktick</a> to have the drow put to death. Though the King believed that Drizzt meant no harm to the city of Blingenstone, he feared the danger of keeping a drow in the city was too great, an army from Menzoberranzan might come and attack the city, using Drizzt as an excuse to declare war. Drizzt agrees with the assessment, and is so willing to end his life that he says he will not offer any resistance. Belwar replies, <b><i>\"No, you won't, for you'll not die this day. Ten years ago you saved my life Drizzt Do'urden. Honor demands I do the same.\"</i></b> Belwar accepts the responsibility of having Drizzt in the city, both for the drowâs safety and that of the city at large. <b><i>\"So I'm not to die?\"</i></b> Drizzt asks. <b><i>\"Not unless you bring death upon yourself,\"</i></b> is the answer.<p>Drizzt is plunged into the world of the deep gnomes of Blingenstone, an experience unlike anything he had ever encountered before in his life. Belwar had not only offered hospitality to another being, he offered safety, if not companionship. A drow would never offer such things, not to a enemy, let alone even a brother, unless there was money or power to be gained. Belwar acted in kindness, and he was now surrounded by former enemies who rose no hand against him. His entire outlook was now permanently changed.</p> Belwar leads Drizzt to his home, where they are met by guards assigned to Belwar by the King. The King has ordered the guards to stay until the truth of Drizzt's intentions are fully known. Belwar responds in anger, <i><b>\"Be Gone! This one is in my care and I fear him not at all!\"</b></i> The guard gnomes depart, and Belwar leads Drizzt into his home.  He asks Drizzt how long he's been alone in the Underdark, and prompts the drow to tell him his story. Drizzt does just that, of his years in the house of Malice Do'urden and the eventual murder of his father, Zaknafein. He tells of his decision to forsake his dark kind and their even darker goddess, and tells of the loneliness of the Underdark, and of the Hunter who threatened to overtake him, body and soul. His story ends finally, late in the night, with his arrival at Blingenstone.<p>After that night, they spoke not much at all except for passing conversation. Belwar was a quiet sort who kept to his sculpting and spoke little. Drizzt, for his part, was not yet fully comfortable with the Svirfnebli language, so did not trust himself to speak well. That didn't stop the local gnomish children from being intrigued by the dark elf, and drawing him into their daily adventures. One day, the neighborhood children are debating the existence of a basilisk. There is a huge, life-sized statue of the beast near Belwar's home, and some of the children don't believe such a fantastic monster could exist. They ask Drizzt if he knows if they exists, and he states that not only had he met one, but he fought one. In great curiosity, they drag the drow to the statue and get him to re-enact his battle with the basilisk. He begin to show them, using two wooden staves to serve as his scimitars, and he quickly looses himself in the bloodlust of the Hunter, not stopping until he has broken off the head of the statue and worn his wooden staves down to stumps.</p> Drizzt, in speaking with Belwar later on, confesses his worry to his new friend. During his stay in Blingenstone among the gnomes, he believed he had freed himself from the Hunter, and was deathly scared with the ease the he slipped back into the psychosis. Belwar tells him not to worry overmuch, the Hunter was who he needed to become in order to survive in the wild Underdark. He is counseled to give the matter time, time and patience, and to relax since there were no enemies in the gnome city.<p>Outside the high stone walls of Blingenstone, the same could not be said. The zin-carla Zaknafein is slowly and surely gaining ground on his wayward son. He had found the cavern where Drizzt had lived for so long alongside the rothe and myconids, and slaughtered them all in his rage to destroy his target. Already the gnomes of Blingenstone are on high alert after finding the results of one such massacre of goblins by the former weapons master. The tention was building greatly each day, and soon the pressure would be too much for the key players in the drama to bear up under.</p><p>News of the goblin slaying quickly makes it back to King Schnicktick, and he and his counselors wonder what to make of it. They know for certain the attack was carried out by one or more drow because of the cleanness of the cuts they discover on the corpses. Schnicktick wonders if there is someone after \"Belwar Dissengulp's drow,\" but Firble, at first, cautions against the line of reasoning, but then does admit they know little of Drizzt's background or why he left his home. What enemies had he made there that might have tracked him to their city. Schnicktick orders Firble to contact his spy network in Menzoberranzan and learn more about the Do'urden renegade.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Honor Regained</p><p>================</p> The King and his councilors decide that Drizzt has proven his trustworthiness, and thus return his armor and scimitars. In additions to his arms, he is reunited with Guenhwyvar for the first time in many weeks. The councilor who had been given the task of examining the figurine did not wish to part with such a powerful and useful artifact, but they realized that Guen was much more of a friend and companion to Drizzt than she was a servant. Brickers, the burrow-warden who returns Guen, tries yet another time to entice Belwar on a mining expedition. In anger, Belwar refuses, and pushes the gnome out the door. When Drizzt asks, <b><i>\"You should go with them Belwar...or are you bound to stay here and watch over me?\"</i></b> Belwar indicates that it has nothing to do with that issue, and certainly nothing to do with his lack of hands. He could cut rock faster than anyone with his new hands. Belwar reveals that he cannot go because the last expedition he led ended in bloodshed, and he holds himself responsible. Drizzt argues in the converse, stating that it was his people and their evil intents that caused those deaths that day. Drizzt further baits Belwar by questioning his courage, a move which makes Belwar so angry he decides to go, saying, <b><i>\"Put on your swords, elf. If I'm to go, then so are you!\"</i></b><p>Belwar, Drizzt and Guen join Brickers and his expedition. Brickers was happy to have the \"most honored burrow-warden\" along, as well as the extra blades and skill of  the drow. They met no resistance on their way to the place where the mineral scout had identified as potentially owning a rich vein of ore. The scouts were correct, and the gnomes threw themselves into the work of excavation, not the least of which was Belwar who carved literal rings around the rest of the workers with his fantastic hammer and pickaxe hands. Belwar was truly happy for the first time in many, many years.</p><p>Drizzt spends his days during the expedition patrolling the surrounding caverns and tunnels with Guen, himself happy to be both free to roam, but able to return to friends and companions at the end of each day. When he ventured far from the expedition, he felt the Hunter try to rise up and overtake him, but he was stronger now, and able to push the beast back down and remain Drizzt Do'urden. Both Drizzt and Belwar returned from the expedition in great spirits, Belwar feeling he finally deserved the title of \"most honored burrow-warden,\" and Drizzt finally at ease with himself and his place in the world.</p> Meanwhile in the caverns near Menzoberranzan, Firble meets with his contact, the infamous Jarlaxle. Firble asks about the increase of drow activity near Blingenstone, and Jarlaxle demands his usual exhorbitant payment, fifty finely cut agates. Jarlaxle assures Firble that no power in Menzoberranzan is moving against Blingenstone itself, but that one House is desperately searching for a renegade. After some more dealing, Jarlaxle names the renegade as Drizzt Do'urden, and warns him that if they know anything about Drizzt, then to keep him far away. The goddess Lolth herself wants the boy dead, and she stops at nothing to get her wishes. <b><i>\"Drizzt is doomed, and so doomed will be any foolish enough to stand beside him.\"</i></b> Of course, Firble's reaction to the news confirms for Jarlaxle that the gnomes of Blingenstone indeed know of Drizzt and his whereabouts.<p>Firble hurries back to King Schnicktick with the news, who then promptly calls Drizzt to his presence. Drizzt had been enjoying his time among the gnomes since his return with the expedition. He had become something of a celebrity among the members of the mining group and their families, and so the summons to see the King was no surprise. The subject of the summons, however, was shocking to say the least.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Leaving Blingenstone</p><p>======================</p> The King announces his decision to put Drizzt out for the good of the city, a move with fairly enrages Belwar. Schnicktick explains that the increase of drow activity on their eastern border has been directly caused by Drizzt's presence, and Drizzt admits that his mother is continuing her search for him. Belwar is angered enough to directly berate his King, but Schnicktick says he has no further choice. <b><i>\"To keep Drizzt here would invite war with Menzoberranzan, and I will not put Blingenstone in jeopardy for the sake of a dark elf, even if he has shown himself to be a friend.\"</i></b> Drizzt says he will be gone within the hour, and he parts ways with nothing but gratitude in his heart.       Drizzt walks the streets of Blingenstone with Guen at his side. The citizens bow their heads with heavy hearts, hating what  has become necessary for them to do. The drow and the great cat walk out of the gates of the stone walled city, and they thud shut behind him. He wondered how long he would be able to survive in the Underdark alone again but for the sometime companionship of Guenhwyvar. His kind measured their lifespans in centuries, and he had nearly lost himself to the Hunter in only a decade. How could he make it alone for hundreds of years?<p>Strolling through the gate, the pair are met by Belwar, who has decided to leave his home behind and join Drizzt in the dangerous Underdark. Drizzt is loathe to let him come along, but Belwar will not take no for an answer, taking off from the city walls and into the deepening darkness before the drow could stop him. The first thing they do is set up a false camp about a day's march from Blingenstone's walls to create a diversion for whoever it was tracking them. They then set off in the opposite direction, into the caverns west of the Svirfnebli city. Traveling only to stop when hunger or weariness overtook them. Along the way, Belwar would point out places to which he had been before on mining expeditions, and Drizzt began to wonder how many ways a gnome could talk about mining and carving stone. The elf hung on every word, knowing that the alternative was silence, and then the Hunter would come. With Belwar at his side, they entered the more dangerous parts of the Underdark, fighting off the natural monsters of the deep places, but never losing himself to the Hunter again. Belwar's companionship was the cure to his aching loneliness.<br/></p>  After walking for weeks and weeks, they come upon a cavern that is glowing with a bright light, and so they move to investigate. They enter a vast cavern filled with a sea of acidâthe source of the lightâand find the greatest danger they had yet faced. Set upon by overwhelming numbers of bird-men, the trio back into a tight defensive circle. Belwar slams his new \"hands\" together, yelling the magical gnomish word <b><i>\"Bivrip!\"</i></b>, filling his implements with glowing magic which gives huge weight and force to his blows as they fight against the creatures. They fight for quite a while, but are sorely outnumbered.<p>Drizzt is able to hold it together until Guenhwyvar is knocked off the bridges above the glowing sea and into the acid bath itself. When Guen roars in pain, Drizzt uses the figurine to will the panther back to her home on the astral plane. Though severely hurt, Guen will recover and be fine within a few day, but the pain would be remembered. Because of the pain, Drizzt called up the Hunter and allowed him to take over. Belwar is left to watch in both horror and amazment as he sees the greatest display of warrior skill and swordsmanship he would ever experience. Drizzt was too fast, too precise, too deadly and seemed unreal to Belwar. It was as if his best friend had become Death itself.</p> Finally, even with the help of the Hunter, they are forced to flee, and Belwar has to eventually call out for Drizzt to stop, otherwise he would have run himself to exhaustion. Drizzt is full of fear that he let himself give sway to the Hunter again. He confessess to Belwar that he felt possessed by rage, his only desire was to kill them all, not out of self-defense, but out of darkness. Belwar tells him he was not acting out of rage, but rather out of instinct. <b><i>\"You saved us this day, Drizzt Do'urden. Do not apologize to me, or to yourself.\"</i></b><p>The pair continues on their journey. Drizzt calls Guen back to him after three days, here fur is singed, but otherwise she was fine and glad to see her friend. A few days later, they stumbled over exactly what they had been looking for, even though they had not exactly known they were searching. They come to a cavern with an underground lake fed by a fresh-running stream. It is small enough for the two of them to defend, and the lake would provide them with ample fish and crab for their sustenence. They were home.</p><p>Across the wilds of the Underdark, on the other side of Blingenstone, Zaknafein has found their fake encampment, and is in a rage over his continued failure to find his prey. It takes all of Malice's strength of  will to reign him in and send him back on his way. Malice, though growing slightly weaker each day, warns her daughters to test her rule. Malice vows that she will remain strong, and that she will one day soon hold Drizzt heart in her hand, <b><i>\"No matter what the cost, we will triumph.\"</i></b></p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Clacker</p><p>=========</p> One day later, Drizzt and Belwar hear curious sounds outside their cavern. Drizzt remembers those sounds, and races out of the cavern yelling <b><i>\"Hook Horror!\"</i></b>Outside, he finds exactly what he thought it was, and gets his scimitars on the creatures neck, about to strike the killing blow. Just then, the monster speaks, something he believed a hook horror incapable of doing.<b><i>\"No...not...monster..please..no..kill..me!\"</i></b> the thing manages to squawk. Drizzt stays his hand, and the creature says it is not a hook horror, but rather a thing called a <i>\"pech\"</i>. Belwar knows of the pech by the name rock children, creatures whose only reason for being seems to be rock carving, and their numbers are very small. The pech tells that it was turned into a hook horror by an evil wizard, and does not know how long it has been that way, having lost all sence of time because it is no longer connected to the stone in its present form.<p>When Belwar asks the creature its name, it either does not have one, or it has forgotten, so Belwar names it <i>\"Clacker,\"</i> a name which the pech approves. Belwar then intends to say goodbye to the creature and send it on its way, but Drizzt says they must allow it to be with them. Drizzt has pity on the creature, feeling akin to the creature being adrift and apart from itself, something similar to what he feels when he is overtaken by the Hunter. Belwar still thinks it is a bad idea, because a spell such as the one Clacker has undergone changes not only the body, but the mind as well, and in time he will cease to be a pech even in mind, but just a hook horror, and then he will be a great danger. Drizzt insists that they track down the wizard who did it, and then force him to unmake the spell.</p> So, the next day, they followed as Clacker tried to retrace his step to where the wizards was. The creature was easily confused, his memory clouded because of his transformation, and so he got them lost numerous time. Just as they were about to become too tired to go on, the entered a great tavern that was dominated by a huge tower made of pure adamantite. Belwar stands in awe at the sight, for adamantite is the toughest substance known in Faerun, and just a small amount is worth a king's ransom, and extrememly hard to work with. <b><i>\"How did he build such a thing?\"</i></b> the gnome asks. <b><i>\"Magic,\"</i></b> is Drizzt's reply, with more than a hint of disdain in his voice.       Drizzt's plan is to hide until the wizard appears, and then take him by surprise, but Clacker in his rage chooses otherwise. He rushes the tower and begins striking it with his claws, calling on the wizard to show himself. Drizzt and Belwar rush to the pech's aid, just as a bolt of lightning comes from above, forcing Drizzt to shove the pitiful creature out of the way. From inside the tower, the wizard rages, <b><i>\"Damnation! You ist going to pay dearly for that one. I vill keell you all!\"</i></b> (a german wizard?) Drizzt pulls out Guenhwyvar's figurine and holds it up near one of the bolt-holes carved in the adamantite tower's surface. When he calls on her, he will her to appear inside the walls, and the smoke that comes from the figurine that marks her appearance wafts through the crack and into the tower. Drizzt calls on the wizard to open the tower, to which he momentarily refuses, but then Guen's roar behind him persuades him otherwise.<p>Inside the tower, they see an empty octaganal chamber with only a wooden ladder leading up to the higher levels. Drizzt is somewhat taken aback to find a human living alone in the vastness of the underdark. Though he is a wizard, he is very nervous around Guen, perhaps not possessing the magical might necessary to hold her off if she chose to attack. Drizzt insists that the wizard, Brister Fendlestick, change Clacker back. He seems to be amenable to the deal, if for no other reason than to be rid of his unwanted visitors. As Brister retrieves his spellbook, the quips <b><i>\"Pech, useless little things,\"</i></b> which sets Clacker off. Before either of his new friends can stop him, Clacker rushes the wizard, cutting him apart before he can defend himself. His only hope of restoration is now dead at his own hands.</p><p>The trio left the tower in silence. What Clacker had done was something no rational being would have perpetrated, but rather the act of a wild animal. Drizzt was beginning to believe that Belwar spoke the truth, that Clacker was slowly becoming more and more the monster each day. He hoped that when they reached the safety of their cavern home, they might find some other way to help the poor creature.</p> When they reached their home, they foudn it in total disarray. Belwar wondered if the bird-men had tracked them down, but Drizzt recognized the fine cuts in the belongings, the mark of a drow blade. Drizzt believes that his mother's assassins have tracked him down again, and so they abandon the only home Drizzt had ever felt he could completely call his own. The three of them pick up what few belongings remain intact, and run all the way through the day and long into the night without stopping, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the evil drow. Eventually, they come to a cavern that is wide open, and seemingly a good place for habitation, but it is emply. Not only is it empty, but it seems totally devoid of any signs of life. <b><i>\"This isn't right,\"</i></b> Belwar says warily. <b><i>\"It's too quiet.\"</i></b> Suddenly, the three of them are hit by an unseen psionic force, and knocked unconscious. From the shadows, a group of illithids float into the cavern and hover over their fallen victims.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Slaves of the Illithids</p><p>=========================</p><p>The illithids, creatures who rightly claimed the title of <i>\"mind flayers,\"</i> using their inborn psionic abilities to twist the minds and desires of any creature that comes into their clutches. Creatures with enough skill were sent down into the mines to dig for jewels and precious metals. The more bestial creatures were sent to the areana to fight for sport, the illithids betting on each match. When such servants grew old, or outlived their usefulness, they became dinner as a final service to their master. Illithids could turn violent being docile, and the wildest animal into a domesticated pet. In turn, they could change a peace-loving individual into a violent and warlike barbarian. Such was the case with Belwar.</p><p>Belwar brought the highest price ever paid for a slave because he was well suited for the two most popular uses of slaves, the mines and the arena. The six illithids who had captured the three wanderers had made a great deal of profit on their catch, and were able to keep a magic item back from being auctioned off, the onyx figurine of Guenhwyvar. They were determined to learn its secrets. Meanwhile, Drizzt found himself in the center of the illithid castle as a servant to the Central Brain.</p>  In the gladiatorial arena, Belwar is set to fight an ogre by his master, being told telepathically that beast had threatened the master, and that he should kill it. Belwar attacks with a ferocity not seen since the day he and his mining expedition had been attacked by Drizz't patrol group. He was severely outmuscled though, and was quickly in danger of losing his life. His illithid master frantically searched his new servant's mind to find an advantage, and locked onto the trigger word that activated the magic of Belwar's hands. Once this was done, the battle's outcome was a forgone conclusion, the Svirfnebli killing the huge ogre. So glad was Belwar to have \"rescued\" his master, he beamed a smile through his gore covered face.<br/><p>While all this is going on, Guenhwyvar has been trapped on the astral plane. She remained unworried, it was not the first time Drizzt had not summoned her immdiately after her rest period, and she was busying herself hunting the entity of the Elk. </p><p> </p><p> </p> Hidden in the astral shadows were the remaining two illithid slavers, having finally deduced what the onyx figurines purpose was. They were observing Guen on her hunt, evaluting her worth and salivating at the weath she would bring her in the arena. Though they thought themselves hidden, Guen sensed the two and immediately recognized them as an enemy. She attacks, killing the astral presence of one, causing its death on the material plane. Then she does the extraordinary. Using the still living illithid as a portal, she jumps through its astral presence into the material plane, ripping it to shreds in the process. Scenting out Drizzt, she runs off into the hallways of the castle. During her flight, she launches herself from high above and lands in the Central Brain, killing it instantly and severing the control of most of the slaves held in thrall.       All over the castle, illithids were driven down to their knees, wailing horribly in pain. Already in confusion from both Zak's arrival and Guen's romp through the castle the illithids were not equipped to deal with the fallout of the death of their god. As soon as the connections between masters and slaves were broken, slaves began revolting all over the castle, Belwar among them. Without thinking twice, he rose up against his former master and slew him with a stroke. Down in the bowels of the castle, Clacker was released from his bondage, and the hook horror aspect of his transformation took full control. Guen and Drizzt are reunited, and are immediately thrust into battle against Drizzt's overseer, a fight ended quickly by a sharp scimitar. After a brief encounter with the zin-carla spirit-wraith of Zaknafein, they escape the illithid castle and run for a day and a night.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Fleeing Zaknafein</p><p>===================</p><p>After Drizzt and the others put some distance between themselves and the illithid castle, he tells them that their attacker had been his father whom he thought had been sacrificed to the Spider Goddess. Drizzt then thanks Belwar for creating the wall and allowing them to escape. Belwar is confused, and states that such magic is beyond his skill, whereupon Clacker admits it was his doing. He tells of the pech and their connection to the earth, speaking of it as if it were a living, breathing thing. <b><i>\"It is, for those who can hear it,\"</i></b> he says. <b><i>\"Yes, pech know that stone best of all. Better than even dwarves or gnomes. For and instant I was not this monster, I was pechâmore pech than ever before. But now, I am falling\"</i></b> Drizzt determines they must help Clacker before it is too late, so he turns their direction back toward Menzoberranzan. When Belwar protest, Drizzt says that his former home is full of wizards who can undo the polymorph spell. When Belwar points out the danger to Drizzt, and asks what they could possibly offer a drow wizard in exchange for such a service. <b><i>\"The wizard's life,\"</i></b> is Drizzt's baleful reply.</p> Drizzt leads his three friends as fast as he can back toward the hated drow city. In time, they came back to the familiar sight of the acid sea, home of the dreaded bird-men. Realistically, they should go around the dangerous cavern, but Drizzt was concerned that every spare moment would count, and every second lost would hasten Clacker being lost to the monster inside. When they enter the cavern, they find it completely empty, no sign of the bird-men remains. They wonder if they cleared them out the last time they passed through, or is someone else had. Clacker reaches the end of the cavern and exits, letting out a blood-curdling scream. Clacker comes back into the cavern with a gaping chest wound and falls over dead. He finally reverts back to his original form, finding the peace in death that his life had cheated from him.<br/> From the shadows springs Zaknafein, his blades flying. <b><i>\"You're not my father,\"</i></b> Drizzt yells. Another voice comes through Zak's mouth, <b><i>\"No. I am... your mother.\"</i></b> Malice presses the attack, slashing Drizzt across the cheek, a move which makes Drizzt finally give in to the Hunter. Even with the added advantage of fighting purely on skill and instinct, Zak fought his son to a standstill. This makes Drizzt think that Zak is still inside the undead body somewhere, so he lowers his scimitars and refuses to fight.       Malice takes the advantage, and moves Zak for a killing blow, but the old weapons-master pulls his blades just short of his son's neck. Malice screams at him over their connection, and Zak is able to strike back and momentarily overcome the control. Zak, the real Zak is now back in control, but he warns Drizzt back. Drizzt thinks they can be together again, but Zak explains that he is still dead, and would rather return to death than cause harm to his son. He tells Drizzt how proud he is of him for not only his fighting skill, but even more so for his courage to do what he had never done and leave Menzoberranzan.<p> </p><p> </p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Saying Goodbye</p><p>================</p> Drizzt and Belwar bury Clacker, and also raise a beir for Zaknafein, believing he deserved a proper grave to mark his passing from the world. Belwar prayed to his gods for the soul of Clacker, while Drizzt, having forsaken his people's evil goddess, hoped that his father was finally at peace. Their trials over, they head to Blingenstone, Belwar believing they can go back and live in the city in peace now that Drizzt was no longer hunted. When they come to the city gates, Drizzt tells Belwar he cannot stay, and means to depart to yet another place in an effort to get further away from his evil kind, and take their vengeance toward him as far as possible from the only people he had ever met and truly come to care for.       Belwar insists he come with Drizzt, but Drizzt will not allow it and bids a final farewell and thank you. Calling Guenhwyvar from her astral home, the two of them travel for weeks, Drizzt retracing his steps along a path he had travels well over a decade before. He could no longer stay in the Underdark. Even though his mother was dead and his House fallen, Lolth and Baenre would not rest until they had tracked him down and slain him. He also could not stay lest the madness of the Hunter claim him forever, so there was only one place left to go.<br/><br/><p><a href=\"///\"></a></p>",

    "deck": "Dinin Do'urden is the second-born son of House Do'urden, older brother of Drizzt. He rises from secondboy to first in his house when he murders his brother Nalfein during a raid.",
    "description": "<p>Amid all the planning and scheming is House Do'urden, a noble house struggling its way up the ladder of Menzoberranzan's power structure. Lolth's statutes decree that one house may attack another, but the destruction must take place within a single night, and the rival house must be utterly destroyed. As long as the first condition is met, no other houses may interfere in the war. The second condition must be met, for if any member of the besieged family lives to the next morning, they may demand retribution from the city's Ruling Council. So, bargains must be made.</p><p>House Do'urden makes such a bargain with one of the city's most skilled wizards, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43475\" href=\"/faceless-one/4005-43475/\" slug=\"faceless-one\">Faceless One</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43474\" href=\"/dinin-dourden/4005-43474/\" slug=\"dinin-dourden\">Dinin Do'urden</a>, secondboy of House Do'urden confirms the payment of his family's matron, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43480\" href=\"/malice-dourden/4005-43480/\" slug=\"malice-dourden\">Malice Do'urden</a>, in exchange for the death of one Alton DeVir, a low level wizard living outside his House in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43494\" href=\"/the-academy/4020-43494/\" slug=\"the-academy\">The Academy</a> school of Sorcere. Gaining this confirmation, Dinin returns home to the throne room of his mother who is pregnant yet again.</p><p>House Do'urden launches its attack on DeVir, pressing every advantage it possesses, both physically in terms of warriors, and psychically in terms of prayers to Lolth. The battle is a virtual stalemate until Lolth grants the prayers of Do'urden over those of DeVir, allowing the psychic defenses of the rival house to fall. In the middle of the carnage can be found <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43488\" href=\"/zaknafein/4005-43488/\" slug=\"zaknafein\">Zaknafein</a>, Weapons Master and First Husband of House Do'urden. Zak is the finest swordsman in Menzoberranzan, possibly the best that has ever lived in all of Faerun. He cuts a swath through the DeVir warriors and enters the chapel of House DeVir and slays Matron Ginafae and all her daughters.</p> Back in the Do'urden chapel, Malice is in the throes of birth pangs, and she delivers her third son, naming him Drizzt. In the hallways of House DeVir, the newborn babe's older brothers complete the slaughter of the DeVir family. When the fighting has subsided, Dinin catches his older brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43485\" href=\"/nalfein-dourden/4005-43485/\" slug=\"nalfein-dourden\">Nalfein Do'urden</a> by surprise and stabs him in the back through the heart, taking the position of elderboy in the House. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43484\" href=\"/maya-dourden/4005-43484/\" slug=\"maya-dourden\">Maya Do'urden</a>, youngest sister of House Do'urden, senses the death, and stays the hand of her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43483\" href=\"/briza-dourden/4005-43483/\" slug=\"briza-dourden\">Briza Do'urden</a> just as she is about to strike the sacrificial blow. They deem the spider goddess appeased by the death of Nalfein, and Malice spares the baby. For the first time, they notice Drizzt was born with purple eyes, an extreme rarity among his usually red-eyed species.<p>Years later, after training by Zaknafein, Drizzt is escorted by his brother (and instructor) Dinin to Melee-Magthere.</p> By his eighth year, Drizzt is assigned to one of the groups doing practice patrols in the Underdark surrounding Menzoberranzan. In one such assignment, his party is told that a noble child of the First House, a Baenre, has gone missing in the tunnels, and that a group of hook horrors has been spotted. Without warning or instruction from his masters, Drizzt races off into the tunnels alone to effect a rescue. He finds the child crying and surrounded by three of the terrible beasts, and quickly dispatches one of them, but just as quickly looses the element of surprise. Creatures of the Underdark, hook horrors are giant creatures with bird-like beaks, humongous clawed arms, and thick carapaces. Quite mindless, they will attack and eat anything, including a drow child or a fierce warrior.       Before Drizzt can gain ground on another of the beasts, it has the child within its clawed arms, and tears the poor girl to shreds. He is attacked by the beast, but is able to drive his scimitars through its heart before it can snap his head off. Meanwhile, the rest of his party \"discovers\" that the child was no noble drow, but just a wandering orphan or castoff of low house, and therefore meaningless to them. Drizzt, for his part, believes the whole event to have been staged, and is greatly angered by the senseless and useless loss of life. He confronts Dinin, who is one of his instructors, and is told to remember his place. As he begins to protest further, they are interrupted by their sister, Vierna. She has come to warn them to be on their guard, for there are rumors of vengeance against House Do'urden, but from quarters unknown. Presumably, the revenge would be enacted in response to the fall of House DeVir from so many years before.<p>This is the first that Drizzt has heard of DeVir, and asks who they are. Dinin answers <b><i>\"House DeVir. On the very night you were born, they ceased to exist. An excellent attack, thank you.\"</i></b> Drizzt is appalled that his family was responsible for the murder of an entire family, and is warned by Vierna, <b><i>\"Watch your words secondboy, the deed was perfectly executed. In the eyes of Menzoberranzan it never happened.\"</i></b> Drizzt also learns that not only was Zaknafein involved in the attack, but that it was his duty to slay the matron and priestesses of DeVir, along with any other children who might have been in hiding. Drizzt is further informed that, as the third-born son of the house, he was to have been sacrificed to Lolth as tradition demanded, but for the blade of Dinin through Nalfein's heart. Vierna tells Drizzt, <b><i>\"You should thank him for that kindness.\"</i></b> Dinin and Vierna leave Drizzt alone in his remorse.</p> Drizzt graduates, and two days later joins Dinin on one of the official patrol groups that kept the caverns safe around Menzoberranzan. In his group with them was Masoj Hun'ett, and a brand new member, the beautiful astral panther Guenhwyvar. Many times Guenhwyvar and Drizzt fought shoulder to shoulder as friends and comrades, much to the chagrin and hatred of Masoj who takes it upon himself to castigate the great cat harshly. Masoj grows worried and hopes that Sinafey will call for his death soon.       Weeks later, Dinin announces to his patrol group that they have been chosen for a rare opportunity, a surface raid. There are to travel for many days through the Underdark to the surface, and there raid a group of faeries, or light skinned elves, their mortal enemies. As they depart, Drizzt asks where Masoj and Guenhwyvar are, and he is told that wizards are not allowed on the surface by law, and so the panther will stay behind as well. Approaching the surface, Drizzt feels the breeze for the first time, and when they break into the night sky, he sees the cool radiance of the moon and is drawn to it like nothing else ever before. Within site of the cave opening was a gathering of faeries partaking in a revel to some moon goddess or other. Dinin calls for the attack while Drizzt whispers to himself, <b><i>\"Such creatures as these are notâcannot be evil.\"</i></b> Drizzt stands back in horror as he watches his dark kind, in heart not in skin, as they coldly cut down these bright and shining people who were only moments before dancing and laughing. One of the victims reaches out to him, begging for mercy and help just before she is cut down from behind. When the woman's daughter rushes to the her fallen mother, Drizzt swipes his sword across her, knocking her to the ground. He has not hurt her, however, and whispers to her to stay down. He lies to Dinin and proclaims her dead, causing Dinin to proclaim, <b><i>\"Finally you have learned what it is to be a drow warrior!\"</i></b> They leave the terrified and crying elf child behind. Drizzt's only consolation is that she will live to see another day.       Dinin's next patrol takes them just five miles outside of the city, where they encounter a crew of Svirfnebli, deep gnomes on a mining expedition. Drow and deep gnomes were mortal enemies, and such an encounter could only end in bloodshed. Drizzt tries to dissuade Dinin from attacking, even to the point of suggesting parley, but his rebuked in typical drow fashion. Dinin orders the attack, commanding them to go after the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a> first, stating, <b><i>\"He is the key to their strength with the stone.\"</i></b> The rush into the gnomes, taking down the non-working scouts first, then heading for the crew leader. The drow are outnumbered, but ruthless, giving out much more damage than they took. This prompts the leader to grab a jewel and slam it to the ground, creating an earth elemental and commanding it to attack the drow. Drizzt races to the attack, but is struck down. Guenhwyvar, against his master's wishes, rushes in to defend Drizzt and is gravely injured, but buys him the time he needs to recover. As Drizzt climbs up to the creatures head and is about to strike a killing blow, Masoj sends a bolt of lightning into them, hoping to kill both the elemental and Drizzt, making it appear to be an accident. Masoj is then clubbed in the back of the head by the gnome leader, who then moves on Drizzt. Drizzt tells him to go ahead and torture him, but the gnome tells him that is not their way. They capture the gnome, and Dinin orders him killed. As the priestess moves forward to torture the gnome, Drizzt convinces them to allow him to live and go back home to tell the other Svirfnebli of the superiority of drow strength. Dinin likes the idea, but not before the take the gnome leader's hands first. Dinin says, <b><i>\"I want to hear his screams.\"</i></b> Back in Menzoberranzan, two separate matrons are having problems of their own. Malice communes with a yolchol to learn the whims of Lolth, and discovers that there is indeed a plot against her house. When she asks for the name of the house that conspires against them, the yolchol says that Lolth will not answer a question to which the answer is already known. Leaving Malice in a concussive flash, the yolchol has now caused confusion and anger in Malice. Who knows the answer. Across the city, Sinafey is punishing Masoj for his failure to kill Drizzt. The ten days Lolth allowed are nearly gone, and so Masoj begs for another chance. The matron agrees, but he is forced to take the somewhat inept Alton DeVir along with him. Malice gathers he household, and puts the males under the whip trying to get an answer to their riddle. As Dinin is being lashed, Drizzt recalls the treacherous attack of Masoj during the battle with the earth elemental, and informs Malice of the deed. Now they know for certain the identity of House that plots against them, House Hun'ett. Malice calls upon the yolchol again to learn the standing of Hun'ett with Lolth. This time the yolchol is belligerent, saying that the deed of wiping out the gnomes does not offset the Spider Queen's displeasure. When Malice asks why Lolth is displeased with her house, she is again told there will not be a reply to a question whose answer is already know. Malice is left angry and confused once again. She and her daughters set out to discover who in their family has betrayed Lolth, but they already have a chief suspect in mind.<p>Drizzt eventually evades Dinin and his family's clutches, fleeing into the Underdark just the Houses Do'urden and Hun'ett are going to war.</p> Ten years later the war between House Do'urden and House Hun'ett is about to come to a head. After years of behind the scenes maneuvering, neither House in favor with Lolth over the other, Hun'ett finally chooses open warfare. Sinafey has hired <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43560\" href=\"/jarlaxle-baenre/4005-43560/\" slug=\"jarlaxle-baenre\">Jarlaxle Baenre</a> and his band of mercenaries Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle, as he usually does, has been playing both ends of the conflict for his own benefit, and so comes to see Malice and report his band's progress. Malice has also hired Bregan D'aerthe, using it as an indirect weapon against her enemies, a way to cause damage and trouble without being implicated in the plots. Jarlaxle reports that Dipree, one of the Hun'ett nobles, has been assassinated by his men. The first strike in what is about to be a very short battle has been struck.       Before Jarlaxle can exit the Do'urden household, the walls shake and they come under Hun'ett's direct attack. Malice's forces are outnumbered, and so she commissions Jarlaxle once again. When he balks, saying, <b><i>\"Bregan D'aerthe is a secretive group. We do not engage in open warfare,\"</i></b> Malice easily changes his mind by shouting, <b><i>\"I will pay whatever you desire. Name your price.\"</i></b> With a sly smileâmost likely because this was how he planned things all alongâJarlaxle walks out to the Do'urden balcony and looks down on the battle. He pulls a small tin-whistle from inside his hat (which has a pocket dimension inside it) and blows a shrill note. Down below, fully half or more of the \"Hun'ett\" soldiers respond, and turn on their fellows, giving the advantage of numbers instantly to House Do'urden. Routed, the Hun'ett army turns and flees back to the safety of its home walls. Jarlaxle slyly looks to Dinin and says, <b><i>\"It's a dark day to be a Do'urden, and even worse to be a Hun'ett. But it's an excellent time for mercenaries don't you think?\"</i></b> Dinin is intrigued, but says nothing.       Now that Hun'ett is out of the way, Malice turns her attention back to her wayward son. Briza and Dinin are sent out into the tunnels of the Underdark with a contingent of Do'urden soldiers to search for Drizzt. They are magically tracking  him somehow, but Drizzt discovers them on his trail and deduces that it is his House Do'urden emblem that is allowing their trace on him. Drizzt ties his emblem to Guen and sends her in the opposite direction, allowing him to sneak up behind Dinin, knock him out and draw a sword on Briza. She tells him that the war with Hun'ett is over, and lies to say that he can come home and take up the mantle of weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses and tells them to never seek him out again. This prompts Briza to draw her snake-headed whip on Drizzt, which he quickly cuts to shreds. She then draws her mace to strike, and Drizzt easily ends the battle, cleaving two fingers from her hand. With the advantage, he holds his blade to her neck, and she prods him to strike her dead. To his horror, he nearly does, but relents and levitates away from her and joins Guen in the shadows. <b><i>\"I would have done it,\"</i></b> he tells Guen. <b><i>\"Despite my vow never to spill drow blood again, I would have killed her. What have I become?\"</i></b> Back in Menzoberranzan, Malice castigates Briza and Dinin for their failure to capture their renegade brother. When Maya boasts that she could capture him, Dinin scoffs in fear. <b><i>\"Since he left Menzoberranzan,\"</i></b> he answers, <b><i>\"Drizzt's skills have increased ten-fold.\"</i></b> When asked if Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe would undertake tracking down the boy, but Malice says that they have already refused <b><i>\"not for any price.\"</i></b> Malice reveals another way, and leads her family to the chapel, and calls on a yolchol. In order to right the wrongs caused by her son, Malice asks for zin-carla. Zin-carla is the highest honor Lolth pays to her followers, the animation of the dead under the control of a Matron Mother. Great sacrifice must be made, so Malice chooses to give her patron, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43567\" href=\"/rizzen/4005-43567/\" slug=\"rizzen\">Rizzen</a>, to the slaughter. Malice and her daughters gather around the sacrificial altar, and Shi'nayneâacting as eldest daugherâholds the ceremonial dagger. Malice takes the dagger, holds it over Rizzen, then suddenly thrusts it into Shi'nayne's heart, and the last Hun'ett passes away as a sacrifice to Lolth. The yolchol is pleased, and grants the power of zin-carla. After much meditation and prayer, the soul of Zaknafein is ripped from the afterlife, and placed into his reanimated corpse, but all free will is gone. As a test of her power over him, Malice orders her undead husband to kill Rizzen, an act which he does without hesitation, flinging a dagger into the unfortunate patron's forehead.       Malice eventually loses control of Zak, and the zin-carla fails. Zak proclaims his pride for his son one last time. <b><i>\"I do this for us,\"</i></b> he yells, and casts himself from the earthen bridge and into the acid sea below. Malice screams and blacks out from the mental backlash, and Briza strikes her with her snake-headed whip and claims the throne of House Do'urden. As she does so, Dinin runs into the room and tells them they are under attack. Incredulous, Maya bellows, <b><i>\"Who would dare? House Baenre protects us!\"</i></b> To which Dinin replies, \"No, Maya, House Baenre attacks us.\" Because of the failure of Malice, Baenre has come to oversee the fall of a House from its pedestal, having earned the severe disfavor of their goddess.<p>In short order, the Do'urden daughters are killed in the battle. In the Do'urden throne room, Briza is slain by Jarlaxle, who comes to offer Dinin a place among Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle sees an able leuitentant and swordman in Dinin, and would hate to see such a one good to a useless death. So, Dinin Do'urden, newly houseless, becomes a lieutenant of Bregan D'aerthe.</p>",

Gaining this confirmation, Dinin returns home to the throne room of his mother who is pregnant yet again.</p> Matron Malice finalizes her plans against House DeVir with her husbands and children, all the while she is experiencing the pains of her impending delivery. Her child will be born this night, a third son who will not live to see the morning. A third-born son of a great House is traditionally given to Lolth in blood sacrifice, and so he will be killed as soon as he has been given a name.<p>House Do'urden launches its attack on DeVir, pressing every advantage it possesses, both physically in terms of warriors, and psychically in terms of prayers to Lolth. The battle is a virtual stalemate until Lolth grants the prayers of Do'urden over those of DeVir, allowing the psychic defenses of the rival house to fall. In the middle of the carnage can be found <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43488\" href=\"/zaknafein/4005-43488/\" slug=\"zaknafein\">Zaknafein</a>, Weapons Master and First Husband of House Do'urden. Zak is the finest swordsman in Menzoberranzan, possibly the best that has ever lived in all of Faerun. He cuts a swath through the DeVir warriors and enters the chapel of House DeVir and slays Matron Ginafae and all her daughters.</p><p>In Sorcere, Alton DeVir arrives at the chambers of the Faceless One, and is immediately attacked. He runs, but cannot get away from the more powerful wizard, and is near his end. Just before the killing blow, the Faceless One informs Alton that he is the last of his family, his house has fallen. Raising his hand to complete his end of the deal, the Faceless One is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel through the back of his neck. He has been killed by his own brother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43481\" href=\"/masoj-hunett/4005-43481/\" slug=\"masoj-hunett\">Masoj Hun'ett</a>, in revenge for years of subservience to the Faceless One. Masoj has spared Alton, concocting a plan to allow the final member of the DeVir family to take the place of the Faceless One, and eventually enact his revenge on Do'urden. In return, Masoj will no longer be subservient, and immediately gains access to a myriad of powerful magical items, the most desirable of which is a <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43495\" href=\"/guenhwyvars-figurine/4055-43495/\" slug=\"guenhwyvars-figurine\">Guenhwyvar's Figurine</a> of a black panther. Once Masoj has what he is looking for, he goes to get the acid and turn Alton DeVir into the Faceless One.</p><p>Alton DeVir</p><p>===============</p>  Later in Sorcere, the new Faceless One, Alton DeVir attempts an ill-advised spell which allows him to break the barrier between life and death and contact his deceased mother. He wishes to know what House it was that caused his own's downfall, but is interrupted by a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43492\" href=\"/yolchol/4015-43492/\" slug=\"yolchol\">Yolchol</a> just before she can reveal the truth. He is warned by the grotesque handmaiden of Lolth that the Spider Queen has little patience or mercy for meddling males. The wizard is explosively punished for his defiance, much to the chagrin of Masoj.<p>At Sorcere, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43486\" href=\"/sinafey-hunett/4005-43486/\" slug=\"sinafey-hunett\">Sinafey Hun'ett</a> comes to call upon her son Gelroos Hun'ett, the man otherwise known as the Faceless One. She quickly discovers Alton has taken his place, but just as quickly is informed by her younger son Masoj that he was the one who took his older brother's life. In typical drow fashion, Sinafey is not alarmed by the news, and in fact seems pleased. She immediately accepts Alton in place of her son to be her eyes and ears within Sorcere. When he begs to know who it was that brought about the downfall of his House from Sinafey, she eventually relents and gives him a name: Do'urden.</p><p>Drizzt enters The Academy's warrior school, Melee-Magthere. While Masoj shares plans with Alton about Sinafey's designs for the downfall of House Do'urden, Drizzt is subjected to more and more of the hysterical ravings of Hatch'net, the chief instructor of the school.</p> For Drizzt's final year at the Academy, he and every other student are assigned a year in the other two divisions of the school, sixth months in Sorcere, and six in Arach-Tinith. The idea is to give the warriors exposure to the other disciplines so that they can better function in their necessary societal role. Unbeknown to Drizzt, he has stumbled into the clutches of one of his mortal enemies, a man he has never met before, Masoj Hun'ett. Masoj proves to be a braggadocio (as all drow wizards are), but found that his time in Sorcere was the most enjoyable of all his years at the Academy. He found that he was quite adept at the discipline, dexterity, and intellectual acrobatics necessary to perform magic, and within a few short week was already surpassing some of the most promising wizard acolytes. If his mother has not been convinced he would be a better warrior and had been sent to Sorcere instead, Drizzt might have become a master mage.       Drizzt spent his time mastering every cantrip and spell assigned, and thoroughly enjoyed being shown magical artifacts and weapons. Masoj grew more and more jealous and hateful of Drizzt because how easy all this seemed to the warrior. Many times he saw opportunity to eliminate the boy, but the orders of his matron stayed his hand. He had no desire to incur her wrath. Near the end of his time in Sorcere, Drizzt is introduced to Masoj's master, the Faceless One. Alton DeVir, still hot for vengeance, ignores the commands of Sinafey Hun'ett and attacks Drizzt in his office. He might have succeeded in killing the warrior if not for the intervention of Masoj. Alton is pounced upon by a great black panter, a beast that Masoj calls his pet, summonded from the astral plane via an onyx figurine. Drizzt is immediately enamored by the majesty and beauty of the animal, for he has met <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43476\" href=\"/guenhwyvar/4005-43476/\" slug=\"guenhwyvar\">Guenhwyvar</a> for the first time. It would not be their final meeting. Masoj begins to hope his mother makes a move against Drizzt soon, before he became too powerful.<p>Sinafey does make a move, but not the exact one that Masoj was wishing for. She calls the ruling council of the city together, and calls for the punishment of House Do'urden for a failed attack. She reveals that Alton DeVir has survived, and has been posing as her son the Faceless One for all these years. Matron Baenre states that the council cannot enact punishment for a crime so long past, but Sinafey argues that they need not undertake punishment, but rather turn a blind eye as vengeance is taken. Baenre concurs and adjourns the meeting by saying, <b><i>\"This matter is settled, my sisters. It is good that we never met this day.\"</i></b> Sinafey puts her plan in motion.</p><p>After Drizzt returns from a surface raid against a group of light elves, Sinafey Hun'ett learns from the lower planes that House Do'urden has lost the favor of Lolth. She does not know the details, but there is something one of the sons has done to displease the goddess, thereby giving House Hun'ett opportunity to crush the upstart Do'urdens. Though Hun'ett is higher in the hierarchy than Do'urden, Sinafey knows that Malice has been ascending in the stature of Menzoberranzan's society, and would one day soon attack the upper Houses. If Malice were to regain Lolth's blessings, then Hun'ett would be doomed. Sinafey tells her son, Masoj that <b><i>\"Drizzt Do'urden must die within ten days.\"</i></b></p>  Malice orders her entire household to stay within the walls of the home, an order which Drizzt promptly disobeys. Masoj puts his second chance plan into motion, calling on Guenhwyvar and setting her to track down and kill Drizzt. Guenhwyvar tries to resist the order, but the magic of the figurine compels her to obey, no matter her own wishes. Out in the wild of the Underdark, Drizzt is so wrapped up in his own thoughts and concerns that he is caught unawares by a cave fisher. The beast lashes Drizzt around the neck with its proboscis and begins to draw him up when Guenhwyvar appears out of the shadows and rescues him. The two of them take the monster down together, but then Guen immediately turns on him. Drizzt realizes that she has been sent to kill and prompts her to fight the unwanted urge to obey. Soon, Guen breaks the programming, and her lifelong friendship is assured. Drizzt get Guen to lead him to Masoj.       Near Sorcere, Masoj Hun'ett waits for the return of Guenhwyvar, and is enraged to see Drizzt coming up behind her, hale and healthy. As Drizzt is castigating Masoj over Guen's freedom of will, Alton DeVir appears and cries out for vengeance against Drizzt. Drizzt tries to strike a deal with Masoj, the figurine of Guenhwyvar in exchange for the Hun'ett's life. Not knowing that Zak is already dead, Drizzt further sweetens the deal by saying he will depart House Do'urden and take Zak with him, depriving Hun'ett's enemies of their two best warriors. Masoj scoffs at the offer, believing the power of wizards to be greater than the skill of warriors.<p>Alton tries to hit Drizzt with a bolt of lightning from behind, but Guen puts herself in the way and absorbs the strike. Guen goes after the Faceless One, while Drizzt attacks Masoj. Though it seems at first that the pair cannot win against the wizard's trickery, neither of them give up. Both fight through burns and broken bones to see their enemy dead. Drizzt has taken a drow life, but it was in self-defense, not in murder or internecine treachery, so he is unconcerned by the deed. So passess the Faceless One.</p>",

It would not be their final meeting.<br/> A year later, Drizzt joins one of the official patrol groups that kept the caverns safe around Menzoberranzan. In his group was his brother Dinin, Masoj Hun'ett, and a brand new friend, the beautiful astral panther Guenhwyvar. Many times the pair fought shoulder to shoulder as friends and comrades, much to the chagrin and hatred of Masoj who takes it upon himself to castigate the great cat harshly. Masoj grows worried and hopes that Sinafey will call for his death soon.       After a surface raid, Drizzt's patrol takes them just five miles outside of the city, where they encounter a crew of Svirfnebli, deep gnomes on a mining expedition. Drow and deep gnomes were mortal enemies, and such an encounter could only end in bloodshed. Drizzt tries to dissuade Dinin from attacking, even to the point of suggesting parley, but he is rebuked in typical drow fashion. Dinin orders the attack, commanding them to go after the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a> first, stating, <b><i>\"He is the key to their strength with the stone.\"</i></b> They rush into the gnomes, taking down the non-working scouts first, then heading for the crew leader. The drow are outnumbered but ruthless, giving out much more damage than they took. This prompts the leader to grab a jewel and slam it to the ground, creating an earth elemental and commanding it to attack the drow. Drizzt races to the attack, but is struck down. Guenhwyvar, against his master's wishes, rushes in to defend Drizzt and is gravely injured, but buys him the time he needs to recover.<p>As Drizzt climbs up to the creature's head and is about to strike a killing blow, Masoj sends a bolt of lightning into them, hoping to kill both the elemental and Drizzt, making it appear to be an accident. Masoj is then clubbed in the back of the head by the gnome leader, who then moves on Drizzt. Drizzt tells him to go ahead and torture him, but the gnome tells him that is not their way. They capture the gnome, and Dinin orders him killed. As the priestess moves forward to torture the gnome, Drizzt convinces them to allow him to live and go back home to tell the other Svirfnebli of the superiority of drow strength. Dinin likes the idea, but not before the take the gnome leader's hands first. Dinin says, <b><i>\"I want to hear his screams.\"</i></b></p>  Malice orders her entire household to stay within the walls of the home, an order which Drizzt promptly disobeys. Masoj puts his second chance plan into motion, calling on Guenhwyvar and setting her to track down and kill Drizzt. Guenhwyvar tries to resist the order, but the magic of the figurine compels her to obey, no matter her own wishes. Out in the wild of the Underdark, Drizzt is so wrapped up in his own thoughts and concerns that he is caught unawares by a cave fisher. The beast lashes Drizzt around the neck with its proboscis and begins to draw him up when Guenhwyvar appears out of the shadows and rescues him. The two of them take the monster down together, but then Guen immediately turns on him. Drizzt realizes that she has been sent to kill and prompts her to fight the unwanted urge to obey. Soon, Guen breaks the programming, and her lifelong friendship is assured. Drizzt get Guen to lead him to Masoj.<br/> Near Sorcere, Masoj Hun'ett waits for the return of Guenhwyvar, and is enraged to see Drizzt coming up behind her, hale and healthy. As Drizzt is castigating Masoj over Guen's freedom of will, Alton DeVir appears and cries out for vengeance against Drizzt. Drizzt tries to strike a deal with Masoj, the figurine of Guenhwyvar in exchange for the Hun'ett's life. Not knowing that Zak is already dead, Drizzt further sweetens the deal by saying he will depart House Do'urden and take Zak with him, depriving Hun'ett's enemies of their two best warriors. Masoj scoffs at the offer, believing the power of wizards to be greater than the skill of warriors.<p>Alton tries to hit Drizzt with a bolt of lightning from behind, but Guen puts herself in the way and absorbs the strike. Guen goes after the Faceless One, while Drizzt attacks Masoj. Though it seems at first that the pair cannot win against the wizard's trickery, neither of them give up. Both fight through burns and broken bones to see their enemy dead. Drizzt has taken a drow life, but it was in self-defense, not in murder or internecine treachery, so he is unconcerned by the deed.</p><p>Drizzt returns to House Do'urden and searches for Zak. He is met in Zak's chambers by his mother and siblings. When he asks after Zaknafein, Malice lies and says he is away on House business, and chastises him for disobeying her command to stay within the household. Malice then notices his wounds, and he informs his family of the death of Masoj Hun'ett and the Faceless One. He also reveals the true identity of the Faceless One as Alton DeVir, and the connections all become clear to the Do'urdens. As Malice begins to praise Drizzt for slaying two enemy wizards and giving them an edge in the coming House war, Drizzt asks for Zaknafein once more. Malice's answer gives him the clue that he has been killed, and Malice confirms the deed, telling him that Lolth demanded repayment for sparing the elven child. She tells Drizzt of the agreement Zak made, sacrificing himself not only to let Drizzt live, but that Drizzt would now be weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses, and yells, <b><i>\"A true god damn you all! And damn the Spider Queen as well!\"</i></b> He throws a flash bomb on the ground and escapes the House while they are all blinded.</p><p>In tears, Drizzt leaves Menzoberranzan behind, taking Guen, her figurine, and his memories of his father with him.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Friend of Drizzt</p><p>====================</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Companion of The Hunter</p><p>=========================</p> For ten long years, Drizzt lives in the wilds of the Underdark with Guenhwyvar as his only companion. Even then, he is alone for most of his waking hours, since Guen cannot stay on the material plane for more than a few hours at a time, and must return to the astral plane for food and rest. Drizzt is still racked with guilt over Zaknafein's death, feeling that his father's sacrifice is his fault. He faces the dangers of the Underdark, defeating such monsters as hook horrors, cave trolls, and <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43561\" href=\"/basilisk/4015-43561/\" slug=\"basilisk\">Basilisk</a>; living off the natural resources and striving to live in peace with the underworld's non-violent citizens. Unfortunately, he finds his self drifting away a little more each day, sometimes losing his self-awareness to a feral side of himself he calls The Hunter. The Hunter is part of what has allowed Drizzt to survive all these years, going off pure training and instinct when attacked by the creatures of the Underdark.       Drizzt puts himself on the move again, knowing he cannot live in his beloved cavern is no longer secret, no longer safe. He runs through the tunnels, into twists and turns which he had never seen before until he ran directly into his past. At the end of his last stretch was a bright light (at least bright for the Underdark), he had come upon a gnome mining expedition. Drizzt follows them for days, hanging back in the shadows, listening to them longingly. They possessed something he himself had never experienced, camaraderie. He was drawn to their voices, their laughter, their smiles, believing he might go mad and totally loose himself in The Hunter if lost track of them. Eventually, their journey ended. He had come to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43553\" href=\"/blingenstone/4020-43553/\" slug=\"blingenstone\">Blingenstone</a>, the great fortress city of the Svirfnebli.<p>Drizzt makes an on the spot decision, and pulls Guen's figurine from his pocket and calls her to him. He says goodbye to her, stating he can no longer live out in the Underdark alone, and turns himself in to the gnomes at the gates of Blingenstone. He knows they will most likely kill him, his people and the deep gnomes were natural enemies, and might attack him on sight. Drizzt was not afraid, the fate of death at the hands of goodly people was better than the horrible isolation of the Underdark. He kept walking toward their gates and hoped and trusted for the best.</p><br/> Members of the Blingenstone city council investigate Drizzt. They are naturally suspicious of him and his reasons for being in the city. Incredulous, they cannot believe that he has not only given himself up, but also the figurine of Guenhwyvarâa very powerful magical item not to be given up lightly. All the while Drizzt sat before them in chains, the Hunter inside him railed to be free, every moment heightening the rage and hunger to be free. Drizzt remained in control, keeping his composure before these wizened souls who held his life in their hands. They believe him a spy, and though he claims to be a renegade, they do not believe him since his House not only still exists, but has risen in stature in recent days. He replies that he is <b><i>\"rogue by choice,\"</i></b> and that he has nowhere else to go. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43555\" href=\"/firble/4005-43555/\" slug=\"firble\">Firble</a>, the gnome king's chief counselor and head of their spy network warns, <b><i>\"Our king will rule upon your fate, dark elf. And though I believe you and shall ask for mercy, I suspect you will be executed.\"</i></b><br/> Drizzt is eventually recognized and befriended by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43473\" href=\"/belwar-dissengulp/4005-43473/\" slug=\"belwar-dissengulp\">Belwar Dissengulp</a>, and taken in to his home. The King and his councilors decide that Drizzt has proven his trustworthiness, and thus return his armor and scimitars. In additions to his arms, he is reunited with Guenhwyvar for the first time in many weeks. The councilor who had been given the task of examining the figurine did not wish to part with such a powerful and useful artifact, but they realized that Guen was much more of a friend and companion to Drizzt than she was a servant. Brickers, the burrow-warden who returns Guen, tries yet another time to entice Belwar on a mining expedition. In anger, Belwar refuses, and pushes the gnome out the door. When Drizzt asks, <b><i>\"You should go with them Belwar...or are you bound to stay here and watch over me?\"</i></b> Belwar indicates that it has nothing to do with that issue, and certainly nothing to do with his lack of hands. He could cut rock faster than anyone with his new hands. Belwar reveals that he cannot go because the last expedition he led ended in bloodshed, and he holds himself responsible. Drizzt argues in the converse, stating that it was his people and their evil intents that caused those deaths that day. Drizzt further baits Belwar by questioning his courage, a move which makes Belwar so angry he decides to go, saying, <b><i>\"Put on your swords, elf. If I'm to go, then so are you!\"</i></b><p>Belwar, Drizzt and Guen join Brickers and his expedition. Brickers was happy to have the \"most honored burrow-warden\" along, as well as the extra blades and skill of  the drow. They met no resistance on their way to the place where the mineral scout had identified as potentially owning a rich vein of ore. The scouts were correct, and the gnomes threw themselves into the work of excavation, not the least of which was Belwar who carved literal rings around the rest of the workers with his fantastic hammer and pickaxe hands. Belwar was truly happy for the first time in many, many years.</p><p>Drizzt spends his days during the expedition patrolling the surrounding caverns and tunnels with Guen, himself happy to be both free to roam, but able to return to friends and companions at the end of each day. When he ventured far from the expedition, he felt the Hunter try to rise up and overtake him, but he was stronger now, and able to push the beast back down and remain Drizzt Do'urden. Both Drizzt and Belwar returned from the expedition in great spirits, Belwar feeling he finally deserved the title of \"most honored burrow-warden,\" and Drizzt finally at ease with himself and his place in the world.</p><br/> Because of drow activity near the city, King Schnicktick unfortunately decides that Drizzt must be put out for the safety of Blingenstone and its inhabitants. Drizzt walks the streets of Blingenstone with Guen at his side. The citizens bow their heads with heavy hearts, hating what  has become necessary for them to do. The drow and the great cat walk out of the gates of the stone walled city, and they thud shut behind him. He wondered how long he would be able to survive in the Underdark alone again but for the sometime companionship of Guenhwyvar. His kind measured their lifespans in centuries, and he had nearly lost himself to the Hunter in only a decade. How could he make it alone for hundreds of years?<p>Strolling through the gate, the pair are met by Belwar, who has decided to leave his home behind and join Drizzt in the dangerous Underdark. Drizzt is loathe to let him come along, but Belwar will not take no for an answer, taking off from the city walls and into the deepening darkness before the drow could stop him. The first thing they do is set up a false camp about a day's march from Blingenstone's walls to create a diversion for whoever it was tracking them. They then set off in the opposite direction, into the caverns west of the Svirfnebli city.</p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>After Blingenstone</p><p>====================</p>  After walking for weeks and weeks, they come upon a cavern that is glowing with a bright light, and so they move to investigate. They enter a vast cavern filled with a sea of acidâthe source of the lightâand find the greatest danger they had yet faced. Set upon by overwhelming numbers of bird-men, the trio back into a tight defensive circle. Belwar slams his new \"hands\" together, yelling the magical gnomish word <b><i>\"Bivrip!\"</i></b>, filling his implements with glowing magic which gives huge weight and force to his blows as they fight against the creatures. They fight for quite a while, but are sorely outnumbered.<p>Drizzt is able to hold it together until Guenhwyvar is knocked off the bridges above the glowing sea and into the acid bath itself. When Guen roars in pain, Drizzt uses the figurine to will the panther back to her home on the astral plane. Though severely hurt, Guen will recover and be fine within a few day, but the pain would be remembered. Because of the pain, Drizzt called up the Hunter and allowed him to take over. Belwar is left to watch in both horror and amazment as he sees the greatest display of warrior skill and swordsmanship he would ever experience. Drizzt was too fast, too precise, too deadly and seemed unreal to Belwar. It was as if his best friend had become Death itself.</p><br/> Finally, even with the help of the Hunter, they are forced to flee, and Belwar has to eventually call out for Drizzt to stop, otherwise he would have run himself to exhaustion. Drizzt is full of fear that he let himself give sway to the Hunter again. He confessess to Belwar that he felt possessed by rage, his only desire was to kill them all, not out of self-defense, but out of darkness. Belwar tells him he was not acting out of rage, but rather out of instinct. <b><i>\"You saved us this day, Drizzt Do'urden. Do not apologize to me, or to yourself.\"</i></b>The pair continues on their journey. Drizzt calls Guen back to him after three days, her fur is singed, but otherwise she was fine and glad to see her friend. A few days later, they stumbled over exactly what they had been looking for, even though they had not exactly known they were searching. They come to a cavern with an underground lake fed by a fresh-running stream. It is small enough for the two of them to defend, and the lake would provide them with ample fish and crab for their sustenence. They were home.<br/> One day later, Drizzt and Belwar hear curious sounds outside their cavern. Drizzt remembers those sounds, and races out of the cavern yelling <b><i>\"Hook Horror!\"</i></b>Outside, he finds exactly what he thought it was, and gets his scimitars on the creatures neck, about to strike the killing blow. Just then, the monster speaks, something he believed a hook horror incapable of doing.<b><i>\"No...not...monster..please..no..kill..me!\"</i></b> the thing manages to squawk. Drizzt stays his hand, and the creature says it is not a hook horror, but rather a thing called a <i>\"pech\"</i>. Belwar knows of the pech by the name rock children, creatures whose only reason for being seems to be rock carving, and their numbers are very small. The pech tells that it was turned into a hook horror by an evil wizard, and does not know how long it has been that way, having lost all sence of time because it is no longer connected to the stone in its present form.<p>When Belwar asks the creature its name, it either does not have one, or it has forgotten, so Belwar names it <i>\"Clacker,\"</i> a name which the pech approves. Belwar then intends to say goodbye to the creature and send it on its way, but Drizzt says they must allow it to be with them. Drizzt has pity on the creature, feeling akin to the creature being adrift and apart from itself, something similar to what he feels when he is overtaken by the Hunter. Belwar still thinks it is a bad idea, because a spell such as the one Clacker has undergone changes not only the body, but the mind as well, and in time he will cease to be a pech even in mind, but just a hook horror, and then he will be a great danger. Drizzt insists that they track down the wizard who did it, and then force him to unmake the spell.</p><br/> So, the next day, they followed as Clacker tried to retrace his step to where the wizards was. The creature was easily confused, his memory clouded because of his transformation, and so he got them lost numerous time. Just as they were about to become too tired to go on, the entered a great tavern that was dominated by a huge tower made of pure adamantite. Belwar stands in awe at the sight, for adamantite is the toughest substance known in Faerun, and just a small amount is worth a king's ransom, and extrememly hard to work with. <b><i>\"How did he build such a thing?\"</i></b> the gnome asks. <b><i>\"Magic,\"</i></b> is Drizzt's reply, with more than a hint of disdain in his voice.<p>Drizzt's plan is to hide until the wizard appears, and then take him by surprise, but Clacker in his rage chooses otherwise. He rushes the tower and begins striking it with his claws, calling on the wizard to show himself. Drizzt and Belwar rush to the pech's aid, just as a bolt of lightning comes from above, forcing Drizzt to shove the pitiful creature out of the way. From inside the tower, the wizard rages, <b><i>\"Damnation! You ist going to pay dearly for that one. I vill keell you all!\"</i></b> (a german wizard?) Drizzt pulls out Guenhwyvar's figurine and holds it up near one of the bolt-holes carved in the adamantite tower's surface. When he calls on her, he will her to appear inside the walls, and the smoke that comes from the figurine that marks her appearance wafts through the crack and into the tower. Drizzt calls on the wizard to open the tower, to which he momentarily refuses, but then Guen's roar behind him persuades him otherwise. Once the tower is open, they persuade wizard to heal the pech, but not before he goads poor Clacker into killing him.</p><br/> When they reached their home, they found it in total disarray. Belwar wondered if the bird-men had tracked them down, but Drizzt recognized the fine cuts in the belongings, the mark of a drow blade. Drizzt believes that his mother's assassins have tracked him down again, and so they abandon the only home Drizzt had ever felt he could completely call his own. The three of them pick up what few belongings remain intact, and run all the way through the day and long into the night without stopping, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the evil drow. Eventually, they come to a cavern that is wide open, and seemingly a good place for habitation, but it is emply. Not only is it empty, but it seems totally devoid of any signs of life. <b><i>\"This isn't right,\"</i></b> Belwar says warily. <b><i>\"It's too quiet.\"</i></b> Suddenly, the three of them are hit by an unseen psionic force, and knocked unconscious. From the shadows, a group of illithids float into the cavern and hover over their fallen victims.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Slaves of the Illithid</p><p>========================</p><p>The illithids, creatures who rightly claimed the title of <i>\"mind flayers,\"</i> using their inborn psionic abilities to twist the minds and desires of any creature that comes into their clutches. Creatures with enough skill were sent down into the mines to dig for jewels and precious metals. The more bestial creatures were sent to the areana to fight for sport, the illithids betting on each match. When such servants grew old, or outlived their usefulness, they became dinner as a final service to their master. Illithids could turn violent being docile, and the wildest animal into a domesticated pet. In turn, they could change a peace-loving individual into a violent and warlike barbarian. Clacker they had turned into a herdsman for their rothe, Belwar was sold as a gladiator in the arena, and Drizzt was sent to tend the Central Brain.</p><br/> While all this is going on, Guenhwyvar has been trapped on the astral plane. She remained unworried, it was not the first time Drizzt had not summoned her immdiately after her rest period, and she was busying herself hunting the entity of the Elk.<br/> Hidden in the astral shadows were the remaining two illithid slavers, having finally deduced what the onyx figurines purpose was. They were observing Guen on her hunt, evaluting her worth and salivating at the weath she would bring her in the arena. Though they thought themselves hidden, Guen sensed the two and immediately recognized them as an enemy. She attacks, killing the astral presence of one, causing its death on the material plane. Then she does the extraordinary. Using the still living illithid as a portal, she jumps through its astral presence into the material plane, ripping it to shreds in the process. Scenting out Drizzt, she runs off into the hallways of the castle.<br/> At that same instant, Zaknafein strode through the gates of the illithid castle, moving down mind flayers, guards and slaves alike. Zak knew that Drizzt was near, and he would let nothing stand in his way, the only thing that would salve the raging beast in his breast would be the death of his son at the end of his blades. Far above, Guen barreled down the endless flight of stairs, carrying Drizzt's scimitars on her back and her figurine in her maw. Taking numerous blows, she found opportunity to take a short cut by jumping over the railing and down to the central chamber below, landing directly in the Central Brain, killing it instantly.<p>All over the castle, illithids were driven down to their knees, wailing horribly in pain. Already in confusion from both Zak's arrival and Guen's romp through the castle the illithids were not equipped to deal with the fallout of the death of their god. As soon as the connections between masters and slaves were broken, slaves began revolting all over the castle, Belwar among them. Without thinking twice, he rose up against his former master and slew him with a stroke. Down in the bowels of the castle, Clacker was released from his bondage, and the hook horror aspect of his transformation took full control. Guen and Drizzt are reunited, and are immediately thrust into battle against Drizzt's overseer, a fight ended quickly by a sharp scimitar.</p><p>Running through they castle, they meet up with Belwar and then race to find Clacker. When they find him, his is fully taken with hook horror rage, and Drizzt must draw his blades to defend himself. He is able to stop, and regains himself, and the quartet runs towards the gate together, Clacker leading the way towards a back entrance. Near that entrance, Drizzt's world falls apart as he sees his father alive and fighting his way through a mass of remaining slaves. Drizzt rushes to see his father, but is met with sharp blades and a mindless rage. In his confusion, Drizzt realizes that it may be his father's body he is meeting, but it is not his father's mind or soul that are in control, and he is overwhelmed by the fierceness of the attack.</p><br/> As Zaknafein raises his blades for a killing strike, Clacker see his friend in dire harm and mumbles something unintelligible. From the path between the battling drow raises a solid wall of stone, separating the two from one another and allowing Drizzt to flee out the back entrance. Zak, blocked by the wall, is unable to follow. Back in Menzoberranzan, the stain of keeping Zak under control is nearly overwhelming for Malice, and her health is nearly gone. He daughters continue to test her, but she tells them she will not fail.<p>After Drizzt and the others put some distance between themselves and the illithid castle, he tells them that their attacker had been his father whom he thought had been sacrificed to the Spider Goddess. Drizzt then thanks Belwar for creating the wall and allowing them to escape. Belwar is confused, and states that such magic is beyond his skill, whereupon Clacker admits it was his doing. He tells of the pech and their connection to the earth, speaking of it as if it were a living, breathing thing. <b><i>\"It is, for those who can hear it,\"</i></b> he says. <b><i>\"Yes, pech know that stone best of all. Better than even dwarves or gnomes. For and instant I was not this monster, I was pechâmore pech than ever before. But now, I am falling\"</i></b></p><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Returning to Menzoberranzan</p><p>=============================</p><p>Drizzt determines they must help Clacker before it is too late, so he turns their direction back toward Menzoberranzan. When Belwar protest, Drizzt says that his former home is full of wizards who can undo the polymorph spell. When Belwar points out the danger to Drizzt, and asks what they could possibly offer a drow wizard in exchange for such a service. <b><i>\"The wizard's life,\"</i></b> is Drizzt's baleful reply.</p><br/> Drizzt leads his three friends as fast as he can back toward the hated drow city. In time, they came back to the familiar sight of the acid sea, home of the dreaded bird-men. Realistically, they should go around the dangerous cavern, but Drizzt was concerned that every spare moment would count, and every second lost would hasten Clacker being lost to the monster inside. When they enter the cavern, they find it completely empty, no sign of the bird-men remains. They wonder if they cleared them out the last time they passed through, or is someone else had. Clacker reaches the end of the cavern and exits, letting out a blood-curdling scream. Clacker comes back into the cavern with a gaping chest wound and falls over dead. He finally reverts back to his original form, finding the peace in death that his life had cheated from him.<br/>  From the shadows springs Zaknafein, his blades flying. <b><i>\"You're not my father,\"</i></b> Drizzt yells. Another voice comes through Zak's mouth, <b><i>\"No. I am... your mother.\"</i></b> Malice presses the attack, slashing Drizzt across the cheek, a move which makes Drizzt finally give in to the Hunter. Even with the added advantage of fighting purely on skill and instinct, Zak fought his son to a standstill. This makes Drizzt think that Zak is still inside the undead body somewhere, so he lowers his scimitars and refuses to fight.<p>Malice takes the advantage, and moves Zak for a killing blow, but the old weapons-master pulls his blades just short of his son's neck. Malice screams at him over their connection, and Zak is able to strike back and momentarily overcome the control. Zak, the real Zak is now back in control, but he warns Drizzt back. Drizzt thinks they can be together again, but Zak explains that he is still dead, and would rather return to death than cause harm to his son. He tells Drizzt how proud he is of him for not only his fighting skill, but even more so for his courage to do what he had never done and leave Menzoberranzan.</p><br/> As Zak begins to loose control of himself again, he proclaims his pride for his son one last time. <b><i>\"I do this for us,\"</i></b> he yells, and casts himself from the earthen bridge and into the acid sea below.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Saying Goodbye</p><p>================</p> Drizzt and Belwar bury Clacker, and also raise a beir for Zaknafein, believing he deserved a proper grave to mark his passing from the world. Belwar prayed to his gods for the soul of Clacker, while Drizzt, having forsaken his people's evil goddess, hoped that his father was finally at peace. Their trials over, they head to Blingenstone, Belwar believing they can go back and live in the city in peace now that Drizzt was no longer hunted. When they come to the city gates, Drizzt tells Belwar he cannot stay, and means to depart to yet another place in an effort to get further away from his evil kind, and take their vengeance toward him as far as possible from the only people he had ever met and truly come to care for.<br/> Belwar insists he come with Drizzt, but Drizzt will not allow it and bids a final farewell and thank you. Calling Guenhwyvar from her astral home, the two of them travel for weeks, Drizzt retracing his steps along a path he had travels well over a decade before. He could no longer stay in the Underdark. Even though his mother was dead and his House fallen, Lolth and Baenre would not rest until they had tracked him down and slain him. He also could not stay lest the madness of the Hunter claim him forever, so there was only one place left to go.<p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p><p>Life on the Surface</p><p>=====================</p><p>Before long, Guenhwyvar and Drizzt's favorite part of the day in their new world was the sunrise. The sun, which the drow's people hated with unreasoning fear, became a companion and guardian to him. His lavender eyes were stung by its great light, and he might never grow used to the intensity, but he accepted the pain as a necessity to become a creature of the surface world.</p><br/> Drizzt was forced to adapt to this new world in ways he had not thought of before. He knew of the sun and its great light, and exposure of not having miles of solid rock surrounding him on all sides, but other things were beyond his knowledge. Biting winds that chilled him to the bone in the early morning were unheard of in the always mildly-warm Underdark.<br/> Taking up residence in a small mountain cave, Guen and Drizzt spent their days roaming the countryside around a farming community  down in the valley below. Met by a pack of gnolls, doglike humanoids that are often kept as slaves by drow in the Underdark, seeing Drizzt as a friend, owing to the drow reputation for violence and cruelty, and ask him to come along as they go to kill their enemies. Not entirely trusting the creatures, but not wanting to immediately mistrust them, he went along until they came to a farmstead down in the valley near Malobar. When Drizzt asks the gnoll leader's intentions, he is answered with, <b><i>\"Enemies. Kill oldest woman, catch men.\"</i></b> When Drizzt asks, <b><i>\"What of the children?\"</i></b> he is met with the reply, <b><i>\"Dinner.\"</i></b><p>Now knowing that the gnolls are evil, and the family below innocent, Drizzt quickly draws his scimitar and slays the leader. Drizzt and Guenhwyvar quickly finish off the remaining two, leaving them in puddles of blood. When it was over, Drizzt began to second guess himself. He was new to the surface world. Who was he to judge the gnolls in such a way. Perhaps the humans and gnolls were at war with one another, and the gnolls had had relatives killed by someone in the human family. Drizzt needed time alone to learn more and consider further action. He sends Guen home and begins observing the family. He soon sees that they are a happy family of hard, honest workers. Within three days he is assured he had made the right decision in killing the gnolls. This family was good, and he vowed to protect them to the death.</p><p>Later, when the barghest Ulgulu murders the Thistledown family, Drizzt takes his weapons and Guen and trudges up into the mountains, where all the signs of the murderous creature pointed. As they neared the hiding place of his new enemy, he heard the familiar sound of the running creature that had stung him and stole his scimitar. Not caugh unawares this time, he catches the little beast, a quickling name Tephanis, and forces to tell him who killed the farmers. After giving the name and location of the barghest Ulgulu, the green-skinned little creature stabs Drizzt in the hand to try and get away, but Drizzt ignores the pain, smashes the quickling against a rock, and throws it down into the valley below. He pulls the tiny dagger out of his hand and walks on.</p><br/> At the barghest's cave, he is confronted by two goblins, which he promptly slays and enters the cave. Inside, he finds the two demonic fiends standing inside, and immediately slips into The Hunter. Ulgulu, thinking he's found easy prey and a final meal on the material plane, jumps toward the drow but is stopped in mid-air by Guen. Drizzt turns to attack Kempfana, and is set to hopping to stay out of the huge beast's reach. Ulgulua shapeshifts into a great demon wolf after Guen bites him in the shoulder, and chases Guen from the cave. Kempfana, meanwhile, has caught Drizzt and is holding him up by the neck. When the barghest opens his mouth to bite off Drizzt's head, the dark elf shoves his scimitar through the back of the demon's mouth, impaling his brain. Released, Drizzt rushes out to see Ulgulu trap Guen near the canyon edge. When the demon wolf jumps, Drizzt uses the figurine to send Guen home, causing Ulgulu to miss entirely and plummet to the canyon floor below to certain death.<br/> When Dove Falconhand and her band of trackers arrive in Malobar, Drizzt and Guen decide they must run, and run they do, as fast and as far as they possibly can.<br/> While tracking Drizzt through a narrow canyon, Dove and her men are ambushed by a clan of stone giants, some of the least intelligent, but powerful types of giants. They throw huge boulders down on their heads, even striking Gabriel in the chest, and knocking him out of the battle. While Dove is caring for Gabriel, Fret spies Drizzt throw himself into the fray with his panther at his side. Between the two of them, they distract the giants long enough for the trackers below to take cover and assume a more beneficial stance from which to fight back. Drizzt jumps from shoulder to shoulder on the giants, slashing at their jugulars and eyes, taking the throwers above out of the battle in rapid succession. Having done what he could, Drizzt fled the battle before those he had helped also turned their weapons against him. Dove is convinced of Drizzt's innocence, and will no longer follow him.<p>As days spread into weeks, Drizzt did the best he could to survive, still hoping the cold weather would not get worse. Then the snows began. Drizzt and Guenhwyvar set off in search of shelter, finding a cave. Upon entering, they find a bear just starting to bed down for winter hibernation. Drizzt stared the beast down, somehow finding a sort of unspoken understanding and accomodation. Offering the bear a fresh fish, the bear settled down and allowed the newcomers to share the cave, at least for the time being. Guenhwyvar, unaffected by the cold, foraged daily for the food and wood needed to keep the drow alive. Otherwise, Drizzt sat cold and alone in the cave, despairing as the weather produced more and more snow, and finally ice. Just when he believed he could bear no more, winter broke into spring, and the snows began to melt.</p><br/> The local Orc Chieftain, Graul, hears of Drizzt's presence in the area. Scared that the drow was a threat to his authority, he sends some of his minions to kill Drizzt and Guen. They found Drizzt walking with Guenhwyvar through the local forest, enjoying his first spring. He was enamored by the new growth literally springing from the once dead ground. So enamored, in fact, he was caught by surprise by the attacking orcs. Drizzt easily killed the first two attackers, but was taken down by one of their feral wolves, pinned until he could call for Guenhwyvar. Even with the wolf off his back, he was severely disadvantaged, and would have been slain by a third orc if not for the timely intervention of an arrow in the beast's back. All enemies now dead, Drizzt looks up to see an old, green clad human bearing down on him with a great wooden bow. <b><i>\"You're my prisoner,\"</i></b> the newcomer stately matter of factly, to which Drizzt responds, <b><i>\"I think not.\"</i></b> Guen moves in to flank the human, and the man reaches out a hand to the great cat. Guen licks the old man's hand like an old friend.<p>Intrigued with the bearing and intent of Drizzt, the old man introduces himself as the ranger Montolio Debrouchee. Drizzt soon comes to realize that the man is blind, and is amazed that he could function well, let alone fire an arrow accurately in that condition. Montolio warns him that he had killed minions of Graul, something the Orc Chieftan will not allow to go unpunished. Because of his blindness, the orcs believe Montolio is \"bad magic\" and will not approach his castle. He tells Drizzt that coming to live with him is the safest place. Drizzt refuses, saying <b><i>\"You would be better served, Montolio Debrouchee, to keep away from me. I bring trouble.\"</i></b> Even after more prodding and assurances of safety from the old ranger, Drizzt still refuses. So, Montolio leaves Drizzt behind, taking Guenhwyvar with him. It was Guen's trust of the man that changed Drizzt heart. He knew that the great cat's instincts had never been wrong before, and he did not relish the idea of facing an army of orcs on his own.</p><br/> Roddy McGristle, Caroak the Winter Wolf, and Graul the Orc Chieftain gather their forces together to attack Montolio's Grove. While the battle is raging at the front entrance to the grove, Caroak and his wargs were sneaking into the grove through the thick growth behind the defenders. Their plan was to come up on them from behind and tear them apart, but little did they know the rear was guarded by the most silent, and possibly most deadly of the grove's defenders, Guenhwyvar. The black panther jumps on the winter wolf, and at first they seem evenly matched, Guen easily evades the freezing breath of the wolf and goes for the jugular. Caroak the Great Winter Wolf is dead, and the remaining wargs flee in terror.<p>When Montolio passes away a few months later, Guenhwyvar and Drizzt leave the grove. Over the next six years, they traveled from village to village, town to town, hoping the next one might take them in. Their reception was always met with fear and prejudice which always turned to anger. Many times the dark elf had to defend himself against senseless violence towards him. Even after so many rejections, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar pressed on, believing in his heart that he would one day find acceptance, and with it a home.</p><br/><br/><p><br/><a href=\"///\"></a></p>",

    "deck": "Malice rules House Do'urden with and iron first. It is through her machinations that House Do'urden rises from ninth house to eighth in the city of Menzoberranzan. She is the mother of Drizzt.",
    "description": "<p>Malice Do'urden is the Matron of House Do'urden, a noble house struggling its way up the ladder of the Menzoberranzan's power structure. Lolth's statutes decree that one house may attack another, but the destruction must take place within a single night, and the rival house must be utterly destroyed. As long as the first condition is met, no other houses may interfere in the war. The second condition must be met, for if any member of the besieged family lives to the next morning, they may demand retribution from the city's Ruling Council. So, bargains must be made.</p><p>House Do'urden makes such a bargain with one of the city's most skilled wizards, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43475\" href=\"/faceless-one/4005-43475/\" slug=\"faceless-one\">Faceless One</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43474\" href=\"/dinin-dourden/4005-43474/\" slug=\"dinin-dourden\">Dinin Do'urden</a>, secondboy of House Do'urden confirms the payment of his family's matron, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43480\" href=\"/malice-dourden/4005-43480/\" slug=\"malice-dourden\">Malice Do'urden</a>, in exchange for the death of one Alton DeVir, a low level wizard living outside his House in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-43494\" href=\"/the-academy/4020-43494/\" slug=\"the-academy\">The Academy</a> school of Sorcere. Gaining this confirmation, Dinin returns home to the throne room of his mother who is pregnant yet again.</p><p>Matron Malice finalizes her plans against House DeVir with her husbands and children, all the while she is experiencing the pains of her impending delivery. Her child will be born this night, a third son who will not live to see the morning. A third-born son of a great House is traditionally given to Lolth in blood sacrifice, and so he will be killed as soon as he has been given a name.</p><p>House Do'urden launches its attack on DeVir, pressing every advantage it possesses, both physically in terms of warriors, and psychically in terms of prayers to Lolth. The battle is a virtual stalemate until Lolth grants the prayers of Do'urden over those of DeVir, allowing the psychic defenses of the rival house to fall. In the middle of the carnage can be found <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43488\" href=\"/zaknafein/4005-43488/\" slug=\"zaknafein\">Zaknafein</a>, Weapons Master and First Husband of House Do'urden. Zak is the finest swordsman in Menzoberranzan, possibly the best that has ever lived in all of Faerun. He cuts a swath through the DeVir warriors and enters the chapel of House DeVir and slays Matron Ginafae and all her daughters.</p> Back in the Do'urden chapel, Malice is in the throes of birth pangs, and she delivers her third son, naming him Drizzt. In the hallways of House DeVir, the newborn babe's older brothers complete the slaughter of the DeVir family. When the fighting has subsided, Dinin catches his older brother <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43485\" href=\"/nalfein-dourden/4005-43485/\" slug=\"nalfein-dourden\">Nalfein Do'urden</a> by surprise and stabs him in the back through the heart, taking the position of elderboy in the House. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43484\" href=\"/maya-dourden/4005-43484/\" slug=\"maya-dourden\">Maya Do'urden</a>, youngest sister of House Do'urden, senses the death, and stays the hand of her sister <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43483\" href=\"/briza-dourden/4005-43483/\" slug=\"briza-dourden\">Briza Do'urden</a> just as she is about to strike the sacrificial blow. They deem the spider goddess appeased by the death of Nalfein, and Malice spares the baby. For the first time, they notice Drizzt was born with purple eyes, an extreme rarity among his usually red-eyed species.       At age sixteen, Drizzt stands before his mother and is proclaimed to be \"secondboy\" of House Do'urden. Malice warns him, <b><i>\"Dishonor me, and I will put needles into your purple eyes.\"</i></b> As with all drow matrons, Malice is not joking in the least. He meets Zaknafein as an equal for the first time, and being both his father and House Weapons Master, he tests the boy's skill and agility. Malice believes because of his intelligence and digital dexterity he should enter the school for wizards, Sorcere. Zak does not agree, and challenges Drizzt to juggle coins with two hands, something he easily accomplishes. Not convinced, Malice prods Zak to push the lad further, so he throws ten coins through the air, telling Drizzt, <b><i>\"Catch them all or you will land in Sorcere, the school of magic. That is not where you belong!\"</i></b> Again, the feat is no difficult thing for the drow youth.       Matron Malice comes to call at Drizzt's quarters when he turns nineteen to inspect his progress in warrior's training. Zaknafein challenges him immediately, drawing first blood as they seek to impress the matron. At first it seems that Drizzt gains the upper hand, but Zak easily turns his sword thrust against him and bloodies him a second time. Malice, however, is pleased that he even held his own against the weapons master, and proclaims him ready for Melee-Magthere.       Malice and her House gather with the members of the other noble Houses to bear witness to the punishment of a failed attack. House Teken'duis attacked House Freth and failed, leaving three noble children alive to make accusation. Matron Baenre brings all of the power that is hers to command, both magical and political, and brings down House Teken'duis. Every last member of the family and all the servants are put to death and the house torn apart and burned to the ground. Drizzt is appalled by what passes for drow justice, and his eyes are opened a little more to what his people are truly like.<br/> Drizzt's revulsion at the punishment does not go unnoticed by his mother and sisters. They deem his heart too soft for their designs, and believe he must be made to take the life of another drow. Covering a servant goblin in the glamour of a drow warrior. They approach Drizzt with a ruse, his sister Maya claiming right of challenge against her little brother. The goblin poses as her champion, and attacks Drizzt. The sparring match lasts mere seconds, Drizzt disarming the false drow with his initial strike. As the goblin lays on the floor at the mercy of his blade, his mother and sisters insist he finish off the challenger. Following the command of his mother, he sends his blade home, but looks away as he does so. Before she leaves, Malice says, <b><i>\"You are a drow warrior now. You have earned it.\"</i></b><p>In Malice's throne room, Zaknafein protests Drizzt's being sent to the Academy, saying the instructors there will ruin him. Secretly, he knows they will further attempt to indoctrinate the boy into the philosophy of the drow, making him a cold-blooded murderer. Zak begs for two more years to mold him into the finest swordsman in all of Menzoberranzan, for his skills already surpass those of half of the Academy's student body. Malice insists that he must attend, because there is more to being a drow warrior than weapons mastery. Zak insists that Drizzt will only be taught treachery and deceit, tools which Malice believes will do the young one well and make him strong. Zak is warned to further keep his blasphemy to himself and not to interfere further in the life of their son, otherwise she will offer up Zak's heart as a sacrifice to the Spider Queen.</p><p>Years later, when Drizzt insults a priestess of Lolth at his graduation ceremony, his sister Vierna takes him to a chasm. In the chasm are <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43490\" href=\"/drider/4015-43490/\" slug=\"drider\">Drider</a>, mindless creatures, drow from the waist up, spider from the waist down. They are created as a punishment for males who disobey, the power granted by Lolth changing a rebellious male into one of those evil creatures. Vierna knocks Drizzt down into the chasm, leaving him as food for the driders.</p><p>Miraculously, Drizzt awakens in a bed a while later, his mother standing over him. She has saved him for her own designs, and will no longer tolerate his \"blasphemy\" of Lolth any longer. What Vierna meant as mercy, leaving him to die as a meal for the driders, will not be done to him again. If Malice hears him ever disparage the Spider Goddess again, she will take him back to that place, not to kill him, but to turn him into a drider himself. Drizzt returns to Melee-Magthere, and graduates with the highest honors in his class. He returns home and acts like the subservient secondboy they expect him to be, but Zaknafein, hiding in the shadows, hears his son and believes that he has truly been turned to Lolth's side.</p><p>Malice gathers he entire household together and proclaims to them the truth to the rumors of war against them. They still do not know who it could be, for none of the the houses below them could possibly contest their power, and even very few of those above them could either. Matron Malice welcomes the coming battle, telling her house to prepare for any and every attack, and when that attack comes, they would rise victorious. Once triumphant, Malice would take her place among the eight matrons on the Ruling Council as matron of the eighth house of Menzoberranzan.</p> Back in Menzoberranzan, two separate matrons are having problems of their own. Malice communes with a yolchol to learn the whims of Lolth, and discovers that there is indeed a plot against her house. When she asks for the name of the house that conspires against them, the yolchol says that Lolth will not answer a question to which the answer is already known. Leaving Malice in a concussive flash, the yolchol has now caused confusion and anger in Malice. Who knows the answer. Across the city, Sinafey is punishing Masoj for his failure to kill Drizzt. The ten days Lolth allowed are nearly gone, and so Masoj begs for another chance. The matron agrees, but he is forced to take the somewhat inept Alton DeVir along with him. Malice gathers he household, and puts the males under the whip trying to get an answer to their riddle. As Dinin is being lashed, Drizzt recalls the treacherous attack of Masoj during the battle with the earth elemental, and informs Malice of the deed. Now they know for certain the identity of House that plots against them, House Hun'ett. Malice calls upon the yolchol again to learn the standing of Hun'ett with Lolth. This time the yolchol is belligerent, saying that the deed of wiping out the gnomes does not offset the Spider Queen's displeasure. When Malice asks why Lolth is displeased with her house, she is again told there will not be a reply to a question whose answer is already know. Malice is left angry and confused once again. She and her daughters set out to discover who in their family has betrayed Lolth, but they already have a chief suspect in mind.       In the gymnasium, Zak and Drizzt have their agreed upon workout session. Zak begins to mock Drizzt and attacks him mercilessly. This is no workout session, and his plan to kill Zak has now been turned back on him. He finds himself struggling to defend against his former mentor. Zak draws first blood, and calls him murderer after referencing the elven child he had \"killed\" on the surface. Finally, Drizzt has had enough and his outrage allows him to regain his footing and gain the upper hand on Zak. Drizzt throws the accusations back in Zak's face, to which Zaknafein declares he must kill if he is to be allowed to remain alive by Malice. When Zak presses the attack again, Drizzt quells it by stating did not kill the child, but faked it for the benefit of Dinin. Drizzt tells Zak, <b><i>\"I killed no elves that day. The only ones I desired to kill were my own companions.\"</i></b> Unknown to the two warriors, Matron Malice is looking over their shoulder through a scrying pool, and hears the entire conversation. In tears, Zak reveals to him that he is Drizzt's father, and is thankful that his soul remains intact. He warns Drizzt that he will one day have to kill drow just as his father had, but Drizzt vows he will never kill another drow. Either way, they both believe they are no longer alone in the horrible place they are forced to call home.        Malice orders her entire household to stay within the walls of the home, an order which Drizzt promptly disobeys. Masoj puts his second chance plan into motion, calling on Guenhwyvar and setting her to track down and kill Drizzt. Guenhwyvar tries to resist the order, but the magic of the figurine compels her to obey, no matter her own wishes. Out in the wild of the Underdark, Drizzt is so wrapped up in his own thoughts and concerns that he is caught unawares by a cave fisher. The beast lashes Drizzt around the neck with its proboscis and begins to draw him up when Guenhwyvar appears out of the shadows and rescues him. The two of them take the monster down together, but then Guen immediately turns on him. Drizzt realizes that she has been sent to kill and prompts her to fight the unwanted urge to obey. Soon, Guen breaks the programming, and her lifelong friendship is assured. Drizzt get Guen to lead him to Masoj.<p>Malice summons Zak and tells him of her knowledge of their conversation, and that she plans to have Drizzt killed for sparing the elf. Zak tells her she would not dare to do it since they are about to go to war with Hun'ett, but Malice says that appeasing the Spider Queen is of higher importance. Zak literally gets down on his hands and knees and begs Malice to take him instead. She accepts, but warns him not to disrupt the ceremony that will mark his own death, otherwise she will kill him and have Drizzt tortured and killed as well. Zak responds, <b><i>\"I have offered myself, Malice. Have your fun while you may. In the end, Zaknafein will be at peaceâMatron Malice will ever be at war!\"</i></b></p> Zak is tied down the spider-shaped sacrificial altar and Malice dons her ceremonial spider-embroidered garb. Ask Malice raises the knife to strike a killing blow, Zak is calm and at peace. His final words are <b><i>\"Beat them all my son. Do more than survive, as I have survived. Live! Be true to the callings of your heart!\"</i></b> Malice plunges the knife home.<p>Drizzt returns to House Do'urden and searches for Zak. He is met in Zak's chambers by his mother and siblings. When he asks after Zaknafein, Malice lies and says he is away on House business, and chastises him for disobeying her command to stay within the household. Malice then notices his wounds, and he informs his family of the death of Masoj Hun'ett and the Faceless One. He also reveals the true identity of the Faceless One as Alton DeVir, and the connections all become clear to the Do'urdens. As Malice begins to praise Drizzt for slaying two enemy wizards and giving them an edge in the coming House war, Drizzt asks for Zaknafein once more. Malice's answer gives him the clue that he has been killed, and Malice confirms the deed, telling him that Lolth demanded repayment for sparing the elven child. She tells Drizzt of the agreement Zak made, sacrificing himself not only to let Drizzt live, but that Drizzt would now be weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses, and yells, <b><i>\"A true god damn you all! And damn the Spider Queen as well!\"</i></b> He throws a flash bomb on the ground and escapes the House while they are all blinded.</p><p>In tears, Drizzt leaves Menzoberranzan behind, taking Guen, her figurine, and his memories of his father with him.<br/></p> Back in Menzoberranzan, the war between House Do'urden and House Hun'ett is about to come to a head. After years of behind the scenes maneuvering, neither House in favor with Lolth over the other, Hun'ett finally chooses open warfare. Sinafey has hired <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43560\" href=\"/jarlaxle-baenre/4005-43560/\" slug=\"jarlaxle-baenre\">Jarlaxle Baenre</a> and his band of mercenaries Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle, as he usually does, has been playing both ends of the conflict for his own benefit, and so comes to see Malice and report his band's progress. Malice has also hired Bregan D'aerthe, using it as an indirect weapon against her enemies, a way to cause damage and trouble without being implicated in the plots. Jarlaxle reports that Dipree, one of the Hun'ett nobles, has been assassinated by his men. The first strike in what is about to be a very short battle has been struck.       Before Jarlaxle can exit the Do'urden household, the walls shake and they come under Hun'ett's direct attack. Malice's forces are outnumbered, and so she commissions Jarlaxle once again. When he balks, saying, <b><i>\"Bregan D'aerthe is a secretive group. We do not engage in open warfare,\"</i></b> Malice easily changes his mind by shouting, <b><i>\"I will pay whatever you desire. Name your price.\"</i></b> With a sly smileâmost likely because this was how he planned things all alongâJarlaxle walks out to the Do'urden balcony and looks down on the battle. He pulls a small tin-whistle from inside his hat (which has a pocket dimension inside it) and blows a shrill note. Down below, fully half or more of the \"Hun'ett\" soldiers respond, and turn on their fellows, giving the advantage of numbers instantly to House Do'urden. Routed, the Hun'ett army turns and flees back to the safety of its home walls. Jarlaxle slyly looks to Dinin and says, <b><i>\"It's a dark day to be a Do'urden, and even worse to be a Hun'ett. But it's an excellent time for mercenaries don't you think?\"</i></b> Malice travels the next morning to answer a summons to Matron Baenre, expecting to witness Sinafey's execution. Instead, she walks in to find Sinafey sitting at her council seat. Matron Baenre appears in the middle of their confrontation and explains what has happened. House Hun'ett has been entirely destroyed, save for Sinafey herself. Malice is being forced to take Sinafey on as her eldest daughter, \"Shi'nayne,\" returning from Ched Nasad. When Malice protests, Matron Baenre replies,  <b><i>\"Many years ago, Lolth made it clear her desires that you sit upon the ruling council, Malice. And now, with Hun'ett gone and Do'urden the eighth house of Menzoberranzan, is shall be so. But understand your dilemma: you have lost more than half of your troops, and it is well known that you still do not have the favor of the Spider Queen. How long do you think it will be until some lower house moves against you.\"</i></b> By taking in Sinafey, House Do'urden gains fifty soldiers of Hun'ett that survived. Sinafey goes home with Malice, her new \"mother.\"       Now that Hun'ett is out of the way, Malice turns her attention back to her wayward son. Briza and Dinin are sent out into the tunnels of the Underdark with a contingent of Do'urden soldiers to search for Drizzt. They are magically tracking  him somehow, but Drizzt discovers them on his trail and deduces that it is his House Do'urden emblem that is allowing their trace on him. Drizzt ties his emblem to Guen and sends her in the opposite direction, allowing him to sneak up behind Dinin, knock him out and draw a sword on Briza. She tells him that the war with Hun'ett is over, and lies to say that he can come home and take up the mantle of weapons master of the House. Drizzt refuses and tells them to never seek him out again. This prompts Briza to draw her snake-headed whip on Drizzt, which he quickly cuts to shreds. She then draws her mace to strike, and Drizzt easily ends the battle, cleaving two fingers from her hand. With the advantage, he holds his blade to her neck, and she prods him to strike her dead. To his horror, he nearly does, but relents and levitates away from her and joins Guen in the shadows. <b><i>\"I would have done it,\"</i></b> he tells Guen. <b><i>\"Despite my vow never to spill drow blood again, I would have killed her. What have I become?\"</i></b> Back in Menzoberranzan, Malice castigates Briza and Dinin for their failure to capture their renegade brother. When Maya boasts that she could capture him, Dinin scoffs in fear. <b><i>\"Since he left Menzoberranzan,\"</i></b> he answers, <b><i>\"Drizzt's skills have increased ten-fold.\"</i></b> When asked if Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe would undertake tracking down the boy, but Malice says that they have already refused <b><i>\"not for any price.\"</i></b> Malice reveals another way, and leads her family to the chapel, and calls on a yolchol. In order to right the wrongs caused by her son, Malice asks for zin-carla. Zin-carla is the highest honor Lolth pays to her followers, the animation of the dead under the control of a Matron Mother. Great sacrifice must be made, so Malice chooses to give her patron, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43567\" href=\"/rizzen/4005-43567/\" slug=\"rizzen\">Rizzen</a>, to the slaughter. Malice and her daughters gather around the sacrificial altar, and Shi'nayneâacting as eldest daugherâholds the ceremonial dagger. Malice takes the dagger, holds it over Rizzen, then suddenly thrusts it into Shi'nayne's heart, and the last Hun'ett passes away as a sacrifice to Lolth. The yolchol is pleased, and grants the power of zin-carla. After much meditation and prayer, the soul of Zaknafein is ripped from the afterlife, and placed into his reanimated corpse, but all free will is gone. As a test of her power over him, Malice orders her undead husband to kill Rizzen, an act which he does without hesitation, flinging a dagger into the unfortunate patron's forehead.       Out in the Underdark's caverns, Zak is beginning to place more and more strain on Matron Malice. Unable to find his quarry, he seeks to lash out against anything and everything that moves. Malice must keep a constant mental leash on him, keeping him from killing a group of gnomes and therefore giving himself up further to the Svirfnebli. His bloodlust was rising, and he needed to find Drizzt soon, or Malice would loose all control. Keeping control on a zin-carla zombie was taxing, even for the most skilled and powerful priestess of Lolth, and the longer the zin-carla was necessary until it came to fruition, the greater the stress. Even Matron Baenre admits that only one zin-carla had lasted longer, one she herself had undertaken, and that one did not end well.<p>Across the wilds of the Underdark, on the other side of Blingenstone, Zaknafein has found Drizzt's encampment, and is in a rage over his continued failure to find his prey. It takes all of Malice's strength of  will to reign him in and send him back on his way. Malice, though growing slightly weaker each day, warns her daughters to test her rule. Malice vows that she will remain strong, and that she will one day soon hold Drizzt heart in her hand, <b><i>\"No matter what the cost, we will triumph.\"</i></b></p><p>Back in Menzoberranzan, Matron Baenre consults with Jarlaxle on the health of Malice Do'urden. The zin-carla has lasted very long, the second longest ever, and the spirit-wraith of Zaknafein grows stronger each day. Jarlaxle also reports that Zaknafein has follwed Drizzt past Blingenstone, and into the \"unpopulated\" caverns of the west. <b><i>\"Unpopulated?\"</i></b> Baenre scoffs. <b><i>\"Hardly. There are things living in those tunnels, Jarlaxle. Dangerous things.\"</i></b> Unknown to them both, Baenre's illithid councilor is eavesdropping on their conversation, and he is highly interested in what they have to say.</p> Matron Malice is called before Baenre, and encouraged to not lose heart. The price of an extended zin-carla was high, but the death of her son would put Malice strongly back into the favor of Lolth, and give her further blessings as well, <b><i>\"glory and power beyond imagining.\"</i></b>  Baenre warns Malice, that if she falters, then the spirit-wraith will as well, being an extension of the matron's will. Malice is also worried that another house will attack while Malice is weakened and out of favor. Baenre assures he that she herself will see to House Do'urden's protection.       Drizzt leads his three friends as fast as he can back toward the hated drow city. In time, they came back to the familiar sight of the acid sea, home of the dreaded bird-men. Realistically, they should go around the dangerous cavern, but Drizzt was concerned that every spare moment would count, and every second lost would hasten Clacker being lost to the monster inside. When they enter the cavern, they find it completely empty, no sign of the bird-men remains. They wonder if they cleared them out the last time they passed through, or is someone else had. Clacker reaches the end of the cavern and exits, letting out a blood-curdling scream. Clacker comes back into the cavern with a gaping chest wound and falls over dead. He finally reverts back to his original form, finding the peace in death that his life had cheated from him.<br/> From the shadows springs Zaknafein, his blades flying. <b><i>\"You're not my father,\"</i></b> Drizzt yells. Another voice comes through Zak's mouth, <b><i>\"No. I am... your mother.\"</i></b> Malice presses the attack, slashing Drizzt across the cheek, a move which makes Drizzt finally give in to the Hunter. Even with the added advantage of fighting purely on skill and instinct, Zak fought his son to a standstill. This makes Drizzt think that Zak is still inside the undead body somewhere, so he lowers his scimitars and refuses to fight.       Malice takes the advantage, and moves Zak for a killing blow, but the old weapons-master pulls his blades just short of his son's neck. Malice screams at him over their connection, and Zak is able to strike back and momentarily overcome the control. Zak, the real Zak is now back in control, but he warns Drizzt back. Drizzt thinks they can be together again, but Zak explains that he is still dead, and would rather return to death than cause harm to his son. He tells Drizzt how proud he is of him for not only his fighting skill, but even more so for his courage to do what he had never done and leave Menzoberranzan.<p>Â </p> <p>Â </p> As Zak begins to loose control of himself again, he proclaims his pride for his son one last time. <b><i>\"I do this for us,\"</i></b> he yells, and casts himself from the earthen bridge and into the acid sea below. Malice screams and blacks out from the mental backlash, and Briza strikes her with her snake-headed whip and claims the throne of House Do'urden. As she does so, Dinin runs into the room and tells them they are under attack. Incredulous, Maya bellows, <b><i>\"Who would dare? House Baenre protects us!\"</i></b> To which Dinin replies, \"No, Maya, House Baenre attacks us.\" Because of the failure of Malice, Baenre has come to oversee the fall of a House from its pedestal, having earned the severe disfavor of their goddess.<p>In short order, the Do'urden daughters are killed in the battle. In the Do'urden throne room, Briza is slain by Jarlaxle, who comes to offer Dinin a place among Bregan D'aerthe. And so passes Matron Malice and House Do'urden of Menzoberranzan.</p>",

    "deck": "Arthur Joseph Curry was briefly the second Aquaman, appearing after the disappearance of Aquaman during Infinite Crisis. His first appearance is Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis 40.",
    "description": "<h2>Birth</h2><p>Arthur Joseph Curry was delivered prematurely when his mother died of complications. His father did all that he could to save the baby, and injected him with a serum that would allow him to breath underwater. The serum gave him gills, and he can only stay out of water for short periods of time.</p><h2>Infinite Crisis</h2><p>During \"<a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a>\", Arthur was being kept at his home, a laboratory where his father worked. There were storms created by <a href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\">Spectre</a> during his attack on <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> and the lab was destroyed, along with the tank that Arthur was kept in. Arthur's father was found dead a year later.</p><h2>One Year Later</h2><p>Arthur first appeared in issue 40, of Aquaman (renamed with this issue: Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis). It was marked with the \"<a href=\"/one-year-later/4045-40777/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40777\">One Year Later</a>\" stamp. It began with Arthur swimming downward, and eventually hearing a voice asking him his name. The voice mistakes him for <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman</a> because their first and last names are the same.</p><p>The voice directs him to a large battle between <a href=\"/king-shark/4005-17772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17772\">King Shark</a>, and many other sea creatures. The voice tells him to help King Shark, and the two of them hold off the sea creatures until more sharks arrive. At this point, King Shark grabs Arthur, and then the voice leads them to a creature known as the, \"<a href=\"/arthur-curry/4005-7649/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7649\">Dweller In The Depths</a>\". It gives Arthur a set of armor that is similar to that of the original Aquaman (orange shirt, green pants), as well as a sword.</p><p>Arthur eventually abandons his position shortly before <a href=\"/blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a>, not being able to take the pressure of carrying on the original Aquaman's position. <a href=\"/tempest/4005-2382/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2382\">Tempest</a> succeeds him on the throne for a short time.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Arthur has a number of superhuman abilities. Unlike the original Aquaman, this is due to the experimental procedure he has undergone and not due to his royal Atlantean / human heritage.</p><p> </p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><p>Arthur has shown he is strong enough to break free from iron shackles and overpower metahuman Vandal Savage, although the full extent has not been revealed. </p><h3>Superhuman Speed (Swimming)</h3><p>Arthur has shown he possesses superhuman swimming speed when he caught up and leaped on a speeding plane.</p><h3>Superhuman Durability</h3><p>Although Arthur hasn't exhibited the level of invulnerability Aquaman possesses, he was able to withstand a point blank bomb explosion that took out a building floor. </p><h3>Underwater Adaptation</h3><p>Arthur can function normally underwater and is able to withstand the high pressures and extreme temperatures of the deep, due to the experiment that he has undergone.</p><h3>Enhanced Senses</h3><p>Arthur possesses enhanced vision, able to see at the bottom of the ocean</p><h3>Aquatic Telepathy</h3><p>Arthur is not able to command fish as well as the original Aquaman, but he can see through their eyes, as well as talk to any creature living underwater. </p><h3>Swordsmanship</h3><p>Arthur has been trained by King Shark and the Dweller in the Depths in combat and particularly swordsmanship.</p><h2>Weaponry &amp; Equipment</h2><h3>Aquaman Armor</h3><p>He wears one of Aquaman's old spare chain male armored shirts.</p><h3>Atlantean Sword</h3><p>Arthur carries an Atlantean sword. So far nothing special has been revealed about it.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><h3>Water Dependence</h3><p>Unlike the original Aquaman, Arthur needs hydration and will grow weaker the longer he stays out of water.</p>",

    "description": "<p>His name is Jarod Dale A.K.A Redemption; he appeared briefly while Superman lost his powers for a year. He appeared in Nyasir to avenge the deaths of a missionary family that grew up in Valley Falls the town in which he lives. They were killed after ignoring repeated warnings by the military government to stop their proselytizing. From this act, the church of Valley Falls dispatched Redemption to protect the shepherds of their church. But the church peopleâs faith was too much for him to handle. And he killed many people of Buranda in Nyasir. The power of prayer sustains Matthew Hightower, which he then channels into Jarod Dale. Jarodâs power would have remained dormant if Reverend Hightower had not energized him. Because the power of faith was to strong for Jarod it made it very hard to control. It is shown in Nyasir, that he can not control his power when the belief in him is to strong. </p><p>From the battle between Redemption and Superman, Superman found out that Redemption's powers where very strong. Testing them by sending him into space, but cold, heat and the lack of oxygen did not effect him. Even re-entry back into Earth did not faze him. But through the battle from one moment he seemed to have invulnerability to the next he didn't. His shoulder was separated with just a pull. Redemption told Superman that the people of Sakira were in trouble, he travelled there and he saved them. On coming back, Redemption had gone back home.</p><p>Back home he confronted the reverend about using him to fuel his desires. But from this, the reverend's people lost faith in him and is power disappeared along with it Jarods.</p>",

    "description": "<p>M-Plate is an amalgamated being composed of <a href=\"/emplate/4005-10579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\">Emplate </a>and the <a href=\"/m-twins/4005-41270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41270\">M Twins</a>.</p><p>Although, the M Twins had already amalgamated into <a href=\"/m/4005-40460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\">M</a>, so that's what any mentions on another website or this one of M-Plate being \"Emplate and M fused into one\" mean.</p><p>Having been made from so many powerful mutants, M-Plate's power was thought to be unsurpassed, while M-Plate was alive. Take note, however, that gestalting/amalgamating powerful mutants together doesn't necessarily create a more powerful amalgamation (the exact power and personality traits are more or less random). However, in this case, that appears to have been the case, so M-Plate was too powerful for Generation X to handle on its own.</p><p>As to what M-Plate's powers are, they are described by M-Plate as being able to \"command the flux of inter-dimensional reality itself\" and being able to distort such at will (in Generation X #35). If you understand what that means, you understand M-Plate's powers. M-Plate has also been shown to be able to fire off psionic blasts, create force fields that require concentration to maintain, bat people away with superhuman strength, fire from its hand what it calls \"real fireworks\" at Jubilee, and kill <a href=\"/chimera/4005-7089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7089\">Chimera</a> simply by firing beams at her through its eyes.</p><p>M-Plate's ultimate goal was to merge all consciousness in the universe into one universally aware being (namely M-Plate itself). M-Plate tried to get <a href=\"/synch/4005-10576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10576\">Synch</a> to synch up with the resistant <a href=\"/gaia/4005-23118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23118\">Gaia</a> to activate the Universal Amalgamator to no avail.</p><p>Once M-Plate had captured members of Generation X, slowly contracting a force field around them to kill them, Synch decided he would do as M-Plate desired and use Gaia's ability to activate the Universal Amalgamator; he felt he had no other recourse because he couldn't stand to watch his friends die. Luckily, however, a certain rat stepped in to save the day.</p><p>Because of the kindness shown to him by Generation X, <a href=\"/hollow/4005-10573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10573\">Hollow</a> in particular, a rodent-mutant named <a href=\"/dirt-nap/4005-7088/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7088\">Dirt Nap</a> heroically rushed in and got the drop on M-Plate. Dirt-Nap swallowed M-Plate whole and subsequently exploded, separating out M-Plate into its representative St. Croix siblings. It's known information that explosions are what tends to disrupt a gestalted St. Croix into its parts.</p>",

    "description": "<p>First seen in Bart the Genius, Richard is a gray haired student at Springfield Elementary School and is one of Bart's close friends. He is usually seen with Lewis and has a leather jacket. As one of the most minor characters in the show, Richard appears frequently in scenes involving the Springfield children, and in the early seasons was often involved with mischief.</p><p>In the early seasons he was commonly seen hanging out with Bart, Lewis and Milhouse, but in recent years he is only seen in the classroom and in crowd scenes. He had a brief speaking part in The Haw-Hawed Couple, His hair color changes from black to grey, to brown, and then to blue throughout the course of the show. However, in Simpsons Comics, his hair always appears gray.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>D.O.A. also known asÂ George Baker is a bizarre and mutated servant to sinister vampiric mutant <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\" href=\"/emplate/4005-10579/\">Emplate.</a> Acting as a valet and butler to his master, D.O.A. is a small twisted grey man with a giant toothy grin. Often aiding his master Emplate in his plans against <a data-ref-id=\"4060-15083\" href=\"/generation-x/4060-15083/\">Generation X,</a> he was even a member of Emplate's Hellions alongside <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40998\" href=\"/vincente/4005-40998/\">Vincente,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10579\" href=\"/emplate/4005-10579/\">Emplate,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25212\" href=\"/bulwark/4005-25212/\">Bulwark,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43808\" href=\"/gayle-edgerton/4005-43808/\">Gayle Edgerton,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5011\" href=\"/murmur/4005-5011/\">Murmur,</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10581\" href=\"/wrap/4005-10581/\">Wrap,</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52814\" href=\"/nocturne/4005-52814/\">Nocturne.</a>Â D.O.A. once pulled a lepton imploder out of his jacket, much to Emplate's surprise. Where or how he got such a thing remains unknown, but it's clear that D.O.A. is a man with his ways.Â Recently he is stated as Emplates last servant. He was with Emplate when they captured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40669\" href=\"/bling/4005-40669/\">Bling!.</a> Emplate had needed sustenance and had headed to mutant and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\">X-Men</a> stronghold <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\" href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/4020-41752/\">Utopia</a> to feed on mutants. Quickly engaged in a battle he fought several <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\">X-Men</a> before disappearing. Conversing with D.O.A. Emplate returns quickly to capture a distracted Bling! She is kept prisoner by Emplate and D.O.A. in Nowhere, their pocket reality and home base. Bling! attempts to escape from her prison, and in doing so she releases her diamond shards, her mutant power, with one large chunk hitting D.O.A. in the head, he survives through unknown means. The X-Man member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\" href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\">Rogue</a> eventually arrives to Nowhere and rescues Bling whilst fighting off D.O.A and several bizarre creatures he has summoned. Returning to Utopia only Emplate seems able to them both but he is subsequently defeated there and sent to an unknown reality where he will be trapped. D.O.A.'s whereabouts, are currently unknown.<br />Â <br /><h2>Creation</h2>D.O.A. is a <a data-ref-id=\"4010-31\" href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\">Marvel comics</a> book character created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40996\" href=\"/scott-lobdell/4040-40996/\">Scott Lobdell</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-1941\" href=\"/chris-bachalo/4040-1941/\">Chris Bachalo,</a> first appearing in Generation X #1 released in 1994. D.O.A. is an acronym for dead or alive. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â <br /><br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Extremely durable despite his small stature, Emplate created and conditioned D.O.A. to survive in inhospitable and harsh conditions. D.O.A. also has powers that are similar to Emplate's albeit on a much smaller and minor scale. Meaning that he can feed somewhat on energy much like a vampire.",

    "description": "<p> </p><h2>Origin</h2><p>At the dawn of the twenty-first century, scientists and inventors around the world began developing mega-tech-- technology so advanced it gave its users abilities beyond the capacity of ordinary human beings. This age and technology gave birth to a new breed of both hero and criminal. As things got out of hand internationally, the world wide government unanimously agreed to ban mega-tech and cease any further production. Vigilantes and villains alike were rounded up and sent to prison.</p><p>A few years later, Angela and <a href=\"/harper/4005-47796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47796\">Harper</a> Temple completed their graduate degrees and (with a little seed funding) began a company named Templetech. Harper served as the company's technical genius and Angela its public face. They had secured a government grant to continue their research and development of some cutting edge technology concerning spectral refraction-- which was not technically mega-tech by definition. The technology had the potential to render its user invisible. Because of this they dubbed their project Ellison, as a nod to Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man\".</p><p> </p><p><i>Who is Madame Mirage? </i></p><p>One day Angela found a man who was very interested in their advances, as a buyer. His name was <a href=\"/robert-rhodes/4005-57698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57698\">Robert Rhodes</a> and he worked for <a href=\"/aggressive-solutions-international/4060-44935/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44935\">Aggressive Solutions International</a> (A.S.I.). When she told Harper about Rhodes, Harper was very skeptical of him and his company. Even still, Angela persuaded Harper to allow her to bring Rhodes to their workshop for a tour.</p><p>After Rhodes and a few of his associates finished their tour of the workshop, they offered to buy Templetech and all of their work outright. This specifically included the top secret Ellison project. Harper was all the more suspicious and alarmed. She turned down the offer. In response Rhodes shot and killed Angela on the spot. Harper swore her revenge and was then shot as well. Thinking the two Temple sisters dead, Rhodes and his associates stole their technology and burned down the workshop. Harper, however, survived by using the early Ellison device to generate an illusion of herself and avoid any actual harm.</p><p>After escaping the inferno of Templetech, she managed to use her technological brilliance to download Angela's brain impulses into a device called the M-Band. Harper then spent years training her body and further developing the Ellison project in anticipation of her revenge. The technology progressed by leaps and bounds till Harper could not only use it as a cloaking device, but also use it to create completely lifelike and solid illusions from light. Finally she combined this technology with Angela's brain impulse scans (her memories and personality) to resurrect her sister after a fashion. This hologram of Angela was also designed by Harper to be a disguise and weapon of deception that she could use while exacting her revenge on A.S.I.</p><p>After her first strikes against A.S.I. she revealed herself to them (wearing her disguise) via video. She introduced herself as Mirage and made it known that none of them were safe.</p><h2>Powers and Skills</h2><p>Mirage is technically a holographic illusion donned or projected by <a href=\"/harper/4005-47796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47796\">Harper Temple</a>, as both disguise and weapon. Though Mirage is a tool for Harper, she is also a near exact-- though slightly visually characterized-- recreation of her sister (Angela). As such, she is self aware and may act independently of Harper.</p><p>Being made of light, rather than flesh and blood, she can not be harmed by attacks while used as a projection. When Harper is 'wearing' the mirage and manually operating it she may be harmed by attacks, though the hard light illusion is able to significantly reduce the damage. By manipulating the 'hardness' of the light, any projection generated by Mirage can be rendered solid.</p><p>However, the primary strength of her abilities lie in infiltration, distraction, and deception. Harper has perfected the original concept of the Ellison project and may use turn herself entirely invisible while 'wearing' it. The visible projections are not simply limited to a facsimile of Angela either. They may appear as and sound identical to anyone Mirage scans (an action which takes only a few seconds). These disguises may also be projected onto others-- which Mirage uses to great effect for misdirection.</p><p>The projections can also be items, instead of people. Mirage may sustain multiple projections at once and at a range.</p>",

    "deck": "Cloud is the main character of Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children. He believed that he was a former SOLDIER, but discovered that he had absorbed Zack Fair's memories. Cloud's iconic over-sized weapon is called  Buster Sword. Cloud fought and defeated the great warrior Sephiroth twice, saving the world.",
    "description": "<h2><b>OriginÂ </b></h2> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Childhood In Nibelheim</h3>Cloud Strife was born in Nibelheim, a village in the mountains. His only friend while growing up was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45198\" href=\"/tifa/4005-45198/\" slug=\"tifa\">Tifa</a>. Tifa and Cloud grow closer as friends while growing up, especially when Tifa and the other children decided to climb Mount Nibel. Tifa fell off a bridge, Cloud tried to save Tifa, but he was too late and both of them fell off the bridge. Cloud was able to survive with just a few scratches, but Tifa fell into a coma. When Tifaâs father discovers what had transpired, he blamed Cloud for almost killing his daughter. Afterwards, Cloud decided he wanted to become one of Shin-Raâs best SOLDIER, just like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44472\" href=\"/sephiroth/4005-44472/\" slug=\"sephiroth\">Sephiroth</a>. One year before Cloud left to train for Shin-Ra and become a SOLDIER, he met up with Tifa at the village water tower. There, Tifa made Cloud promise that he will protect her whenever she was in trouble. Eventually, Cloud would leave Nibelheim for training at Shin-Ra.  <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><b><i>Â <br/></i></b> <h3>Training at Shinra</h3>Years of training go by, and Cloud was still unable to become an elite SOLDIER. Instead, he became an ordinary Shin-Ra guard. Eventually, Cloud would be assigned on an assignment that takes him back to his home town Nibelheim. They were to investigate the Mako Reactor at Mount Nibel because it has been having some problems. Cloud was accompanied by the legendary Sephiroth and another first-class SOLDIER named Zack Fair. When Cloud arrived at Nibelheim, Tifa was anxiously waiting to see Cloud. However, he decided to hide himself by keeping his helmet on because he was ashamed to show himself as a low-class soldier to Tifa. They head straight to the Mako Reactor with Tifa as their guide. There, Sephiroth discovers the failed experiments and his mother, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54970\" href=\"/jenova/4005-54970/\" slug=\"jenova\">Jenova</a>. Sephiroth began to fall into madness after discovering Hojoâs lost experiments and began reading the logs of Professor Gast (A Shinra researcher) at the Shin-Ra Mansion library. Sephiroth would then discover the basement in the Shin-Ra mansion and found more answers. He then proceeded to setting fire and destroying the village. Meanwhile, Cloud was able to just witness the death of his mother in the fire. He then headed to the Reactor to find out who did it. Finally arriving at the Reactor, he discovers Tifa and Zack wounded by Sephiroth. Cloud picks up Zackâs Buster Sword and angrily charges toward Sephiroth. Sephiroth was caught off guard and Cloud was able to stab him in the stomach, while Cloud was stabbed by Sephirothâs sword too. Cloud was able to push Sephiroth off the cliff and into the Lifestream. After the incident, Shin-Ra created a cover-up for it. They replaced all the townspeople with Shin-Ra employees and imprisoned Cloud and Zack in the Shin-Ra mansion. They used Cloud and Zack in their experiments and injected them with mako and Jenova cells.Â   <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53433/995152-keep_on_livin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-995152\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53433/995152-keep_on_livin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-995152\"><img alt=\"Cloud receiving the Buster Sword\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53433/995152-keep_on_livin.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/53433/995152-keep_on_livin.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Cloud receiving the Buster Sword</figcaption></figure><br/><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Cloud and Zack</h3>Five years after being experimented on, Zack was eventually able to break Cloud and himself out. CloudÂ had Mako poisoningÂ from the experiments, so Zack had to help Cloud escape. Zack planned to become a mercenary and offered Cloud to join him, but since Cloud was stillÂ poisoned he could not answer. While on their way to Midgar, Zack was finally defeated andÂ shot to death by Shin-Ra agents. Cloud was left alone because he looked like he was going to die anyways.Cloud crawled over to Zack who used his final breathe to tellÂ Cloud to live on as Zack's living legacy.Â The Jenova cells began to react, and it made him believe that Zackâs life and stories about being a First class SOLDIERÂ were his own. Cloud thenÂ draggedÂ the Buster Sword and headed towards Midgar.Â <br/><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h2>Final Fantasy 7</h2> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <p>Cloud would arrive in Midgar and claimed to be an ex-SOLDIER and a mercenary for hire. There he reunited with Tifa and was introduced to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45229\" href=\"/barret/4005-45229/\" slug=\"barret\">Barret</a>. Tifa recommended to Barret that they hire Cloud to join the AVALANCE group, Barret skeptically hires Cloud. Their first job together was to blow up one of the Mako Reactors. They were successful but Cloud was separated during the escape. Eventually Cloud would catch up to them and head back to Tifaâs bar. On the way, Cloud meets a flower girl named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45227\" href=\"/aerith/4005-45227/\" slug=\"aerith\">Aerith</a> for the first time. He would finally arrive back at the bar and the AVALANCHE would plan their next mission. After they finish preparing and planning, they head to the next Mako Reactor. However, the President of Shinra would set a trap for them, and just as they were going escape after planting the bomb, they were attacked by a robot guard. They successfully defeat the guard but the explosion causes Cloud to fall off the upper levels and down to the slums. Cloud falls through a roof of a church and luckily, cushioned by a bed of flowers. There, he meets Aerith again and they talk for a while, then she tells him about her situation with kidnappers. Cloud agrees to be her bodyguard and escort her home. Just as they were about to leave, Shinra Turks arrive to try and capture Aerith. After Cloud was able to fend off the Turks, he agrees to take her back to Sector 7, her home. On their way back to Aerith's place, she remembers about her boyfriend that was a SOLDIER just like Cloud. After he was able to escort her home, Aerith asks her mother if she could take Cloud back to where he needed to go. They then headed for Tifaâa bar, however on the way the two discover Tifa being taken to an area in Sector 6 called Wall Market, infamous for criminal activities. They follow her but then she enters a building, Cloud and Aerith try to enter too but are rejected because Cloud is a man. Aerith then decides to dress Cloud up as a girl, and with that they were able to enter the crime lord Don Corneoâs place. They find Tifa in the basement and then proceeded to seducing Corneo to find out what Shinraâs plans were. They discover that Shinra already knows the location of AVALANCHEâs hide out and planned to blow up the upper level of Sector 7 to drop it on the slums below. Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa rush back to Sector 7 and battled Shinra to try and stop the explosion. However, they were unsuccessful and Shinra was able to blow up Sector 7 killing the entire population in the slums, including 3 AVALANCHE members, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie. Shinra was also able to kidnap Aeris finally and took her back to their headquarters. Aerith was also revealed to be a decendant of an ancient race called the âCetra.â Shinra believes that she is the key to taking them to the âPromised Land.âÂ </p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147559-72643-cloud-strife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-147559\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.76153846153846\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147559-72643-cloud-strife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-147559\"><img alt=\"Cloud as he appears in Final Fantasy VII\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147559-72643-cloud-strife.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/147559-72643-cloud-strife.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" data-width=\"260\"></a><figcaption>Cloud as he appears in Final Fantasy VII</figcaption></figure> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Â </h3> <h3>Saving Aerith</h3>Cloud, Tifa, and Barret are the only remaining AVALANCHE members alive. They began planning to infiltrate Shinraâs headquarters and rescue Aerith. The three of them travel back to Sector 6âs Market Wall and towards a giant wall. They climbed up the wall and were on private Shinra territory afterwards. They had to head up all the way to the top of the Shinra tower, and eventually made it to the lab that Aerith was held in. They rescue Aerith from a wolf, however the wolf was then revealed to be from an ancient race, and his name was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45230\" href=\"/red-xiii/4005-45230/\" slug=\"red-xiii\">Red XIII</a>. Now with 5 people in a group, they decide to split into two groups and head for the exit. On the way out, Cloud discovers a headless Jenova and it terrified him. However, all of them would be captured and imprisoned shortly after. Everyone was tired so they all decided to sleep, Cloud would wake up in the middle of the night and discover his door opened. After stepping out of his cell, he discover his guard dead on the floor and horribly slaughtered.  <p>Cloud wakes everyone up and they follow the blood trail to the top floor. They head into the presidentâs office and discover that he was stabbed in the back with Sephirothâs sword. Cloud discovers that Sephiroth had said that he will not allow Shinra to find the Promise Land, and that the headless Jenova disappeared from the lab. He then hears a helicopter and head outside to see Rufus Shinra, the son of the president, fleeing the scene. Cloud tries to stop him in a battle, but was unsuccessful. Everyone else had already headed downstairs and Cloud would go after them after the fight with Rufus. Cloud finds a motorcycle while the group rode a truck. On the motorcycle, Cloud protected the groupâs truck with his sword until they reached the outskirts of Midgar.Â </p><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Leaving Midgar</h3>The group headed towards a nearby town called Kalm, and stayed at the local inn. There, Cloud tells his memories of what happened at Nibelheim, except that he was in Zackâs shoes. Tifa did not say anything because she was confused about Cloudâs memories. The group then decides to pursue after Sephiroth, where ever he is, and put a stop to whatever he is planning. Their first stop was at Junon, on the way to Junon they meet a young ninja named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45231\" href=\"/yuffie/4005-45231/\" slug=\"yuffie\">Yuffie</a>. She is a ninja from the Wutai village, and at first she steals all the groupâs materia. Eventually the group would get the materia back from Yuffie after they save her from Don Corneo. Yuffie decides to join the group and they finally arrive at Junon. They take the boat across the ocean and decided to travel to Nibelheim to find more answers. When they arrived at Nibelheim, they discover the people act like the Sephiroth incident never happened. They investigate the Shinra Mansion where they discover <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45228\" href=\"/vincent/4005-45228/\" slug=\"vincent\">Vincent</a> in the basement. All Cloud got at the mansion was more questions, as he begins to question his own memories. They then continue to search for Sephiroth, stopping by the Gold Saucer to rest and have a little fun. They then meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45233\" href=\"/cait-sith/4005-45233/\" slug=\"cait-sith\">Cait Sith</a>, a robot controlled by a Shinra employee. They would stop by Red XIIIâs home town at Cosmo Canyon, where they learn more about Aerithâs Cetra race. Their next ally would be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45232\" href=\"/cid-highwind/4005-45232/\" slug=\"cid-highwind\">Cid Highwind</a>, whom they meet at Rocket Town. With Cid they were able to use his plane for easier travel. They decide to travel to the Temple of the Ancients to find the Black Materia. Cloud was able to obtain the Black Materia, however, Sephiroth manipulated him into giving it to Sephiroth. Sephiroth reveals that his plan was to use the Black Materia to activate the Meteor ability, claiming that if he used the Meteor to injure the planet, it would force the Lifestream to heal the planet and therefore opening the Promise Land to him.Â <br/><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>The Death of Aerith</h3>Afterwards, Aerith decided to leave the party and head over to the Forgotten City to stop Sephirothâs plan. Cloud and company decide to follow Aerith to the ancient Cetra city. After entering the city, Cloud and the others discover Aerith praying to the planet, Sephiroth was hidden in the shadows and was trying to influence Cloud into killing Aerith himself. However, Could was able to resist Sephirothâs influence, so Sephiroth decided to swoop down and stabs his sword through Aerithâs heart. As her white material fall into the water, Cloud rushes to her side. Sephiroth continues to taunt Cloud and then leaves him. Cloud takes Aerith into the lake and drops her in there for her burial. Afterwards, the group decides that they must kill Sephiroth to avenge her.Â <br/><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Cloud's Suffering</h3> <p>While going after Sephirorth, he began playing mind games against Cloud and forced him to believe that he was not really human, but rather one of Professor Hojoâs experiments of Jenova. During this time, it was revealed what Jenova was and why it came to Earth. It also destroyed most of the Cetra race, and was the reason for the creation of the Weapons (The Weapons went into hibernation after Jenova was defeated). Sephiroth would be revealed to be a Cetra made of Jenova cells and is the reason why he went insane. When Cloud and company finally reach the Northern Crater to confront Sephiroth, he tells Cloud that he was not really at Nibelheim, and that his memories are of another 1st Class SOLDIER named Zack. Since Tifa had to confirm this, Cloud mentally breaks down and gives Sephiroth enough time to cast Meteor. The Weapons reawaken and the Lifestream appears. Cloud falls into the Lifestream shortly afterwards. The group would eventually find Cloud washed up onto a tropical island resort. There, they discover that he is in a catatonic state (A mental and physical illness that causes the individual to be mute and unable to move or make eye contact). Tifa stays behind to take care of him in his catatonic state. Meanwhile, the Weapons have declared everything a threat to the planet and began wrecking havoc, that havoc would lead to the island that the group was on, causing the island to split in half. Cloud and Tifa then fall into the Lifestream together, where she was able to help reconstruct Cloudâs memories and restore the missing pieces. Cloud now remembers that he is really human and he was at Nibelheim during the Sephiroth incident, but as a low class soldier.Â </p><br/> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3>Sephiroth's Defeat</h3>After Cloud reawakens, he learns that before Aerith died, she casted a spell called Holy to counter the Meteor. However, Sephiroth was able to focus on it and keep the spell from going into affect. They decided that the planet needs to be saved from the Weapons first, so the group teams up with Shinra to battle the Weapons. They succeed but many Shinra were killed in the process. Hojo is revealed to be Sephirothâs father as Sephiroth was the unborn baby offered to be a Jenova experiment. However, when Hojo decided to try and take the Lifestream and use it for himself, Cloud and company had no choice but the kill him. Afterwards, the group travels through the mantle of the planet and arriving at the planetâs core. There, the entire group has to fight against a monstrous Sephiroth. After a hard fought battle, Cloud and company defeats a monster Sephiroth. However, Sephiroth was dead in body but his mind remained in the life stream. He called Clouds conciousness into the life stream for a final one on one battle. Cloud unleashes his Omnislash on Sephiroth, killing him which resulted in Holy being unleashed. With the help of the Lifestream, the Meteor was destroyed. Cloud caught Tifa before she could plunge into the abyss and the group escapes via Cidâs Highwind. Afterwords, the planet and its civilization begin the rebuilding process.Â   <p><br/></p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h2><i><b>Case of Tifa</b><br/></i></h2> <p>After the events of Final Fantasy 7, Cloud has been living with Tifa in a city called Edge. After helping build the new 7th Heaven Cloud goes out in search of supplies. During this time he comes in possession of a new motorcycle. After this with Tifa's help he sets up theÂ  âStrife Delivery Serviceâ . They have also begin raising Marlene (Barretâs adoptive daughter) together.Â  Some time after setting up his delivery service Cloud gets an order to deliver flowers to Aerith's grave. This leads to him growing distant from Tifa and Marlene over time. Behind these actions are guilt associated with his painful memories of failing to protect those important to him including Zack and Aerith. During this depressions and his seeking forgiveness he finds Denzel and brings him home. Denzel suffers from Geostigma (called âSeikon Shokogunâ in Japanese, translate to âPlanet Scar Syndromeâ). Both Tifa and Cloud feel Denzel was brought to them for a purpose. To absolve guilt for past sins. Tifa by raising him. Cloud by saving him. Thus Denzel Joins Cloud and Tifa's family. Cloud begins to reconnect with his family after the arrival of Denzel but in the course of making deliveries and looking for a cure for Denzel he also contracts Geostigma.Â  Cloud then disappears.Â Â  Â  <br/>Â </p> <h2>Advent Children</h2>Â While he was out on a delivery, Cloud receives a call from Tifa telling him that Reno has a job for him. Cloud was standing on the outskirts of Midgar, the same place where Zack died and where he left the Buster Sword. Cloud tells Zack that he wanted to live his life for the both of them, then he headed to Reno. Cloud was then attacked by three mysterious strangers named Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo. They claimed to be Sephirothâs remains before he tried to jump into the Lifestream. Cloud was able to fend them off on his motorcycle, and the three would eventually leave. Kenshin finally arrives at the location Reno said. There he meets with Rufus who offers him the job to fight the three mystery men, but Cloud rejects the offer and leaves. Meanwhile, Kadaj and his brothers have been gathering children that are infected with Geostigma, one of which is Denzel. Tifa and Marlene went to the church to see if Cloud was there, however he was not. Tifa would encounter Yazoo and the two began fighting. Yazoo defeats Tifa in the end and takes Marlene and a chest full of materia. Cloud eventually returns back to the church, where he discovers Tifa had been beaten. However, Cloud could not do anything as the Geostigma began hurting him until he passed out. Cloud enters a white area and talks to Aerith, still trying to figure out a way to be forgiven. When he awakens, he realizes that the Turks helped him back to Tifaâs tavern, and learned that the children have been taken by Kadajâs gang to the City of Ancients.  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-144069\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.295\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-144069\"><img alt=\"Cloud as he appears in Advent Children\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cloud as he appears in Advent Children\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/144069-81293-cloud-strife.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cloud as he appears in Advent Children</figcaption></figure> <p>After an argument with the Turks, then an argument with Tifa about not letting her help, Cloud rushes to the City of Ancients to rescue the children. There, he began battling all three of them, but quickly knew he was outmatched. Eventually, Vincent comes in and saves Cloud from getting killed. Marlene was able to escape and ran to Cloud, asking him to take her home. Cloud tries to get Vincent to take her home, but Marlene wanted Cloud to. Cloud then asks Vincent if it is okay to forgive himself, to which Vincent replies that he has never tried. Cloud then realizes that he should try to forgive himself first, and decides to take Marlene back home. When they arrive back at Edge city, Kadaj had just unleashed Bahamut on the city. Tifa, Cid, Barret, Yuffie, Vincent, Red XIII, and Cait Sith are all fight Bahamut when Cloud arrives. Cloud then takes on Bahamut one on one, the end result was Cloud slicing Bahamut in half, defeating him. After defeating Bahamut, Cloud goes after Kadaj, who just got his hands on the last remains of Jenova.Â </p><br/> <h3>Sephiroth's Resurrection and Death</h3>Cloud races after Kadaj and his brothers on a motorcycle. Yazoo and Loz engage against Cloud on a motorcycle, Cloud would eventually hold them off long enough to let the Turks set bombs for them. After losing Yazoo and Loz off his tail, Cloud heads straight for Kadaj. He chases Kadaj to the church, where the Lifestream water was activated and healed his Geostigma. Cloud continues after Kadaj, and the two finally clash swords against each other. Cloud was able to beat Kadaj, but was not able to stop him from drinking the remains of Jenova as he fell off a tall building. Cloud charges at him but it was too late and Sephiroth was reborn. Cloud and Sephiroth have an epic battle against each other, destroy building after building. However, Sephiroth was just toying with Cloud, eventually stabbing him on the shoulder and pinning him to a wall. Sephiroth then asks Cloud what he cherishes most so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. Angered by his words, Cloud is able to pull Sephirothâs sword out of his shoulder and replies \" I pity you, you just don't get it at all... <i><b>There's not a thing I don't cherish! </b>\"</i>Â Cloud then unleashes  <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777311\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.626\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777311\"><img alt=\"Cloud performing the Omnislash Version 6\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 500w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cloud performing the Omnislash Version 6\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 500w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 480w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/4/47107/1777311-omnislash_v6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cloud performing the Omnislash Version 6</figcaption></figure>his âOmnislash Version 6â and slashes through Sephiroth. Cloud tells Sephiroth to stay where he belongs, in his memories, but Sephiroth promises that he \"will never be a memory\". Afterwards, Sephiroth disappears, leaving Kadaj to die. Kadaj hears Aerisâ voice whom he thinks is his mother. Kadaj then diffuses into the Lifestream along with his brothers. As for Cloud, Aerith and Zack does not allow Cloud to enter the Lifestream and he is taken back to the church. Back at the church, Cloud uses the Lifestream water to cure the Geostigma from Denzil and the rest of the children. After sharing a smile with Tifa, Cloud catches Aerith and Zack standing near the entrance, as Aerith walks away, she turns around and smiles at him, then leaves with Zack. Cloud is finally free from the guilty burden he had been carrying and returns home. <br/><br/> <h2>Power and Abilities<br/></h2>Due to experiments conducted on him by Shinra, Cloud has superhuman strength, speed, stamina and agility.Â Cloud strength is such that he is able to expertly wield the enormous Buster Sword, and the even larger First Tsurugi with one hand, and has shown the ability to slice through several metres of stone with one swing of his blade. His speed is slightly above peak human, and can be observed within the swiftness of his combat techniques. His stamina is so great that while infected with Geostigma, he was capable of battling the three Remnants of Sephiroth on equal footing, while it took only one to defeat Tifa Lockhart in hand-to-hand combat. His agility is enhanced to the point where he can perform feats of tremendous acrobatic prowess while fighting and riding a motorcycle simultaneously.<br/>Additionally, Cloud is an expert swordsman, having defeated Sephiroth, arguably the most powerful being to have ever existed in the Final Fantasy VII Universe, twice in single combat. He has battled the three Remnants of Sephiroth at the same time on equal footing, whilst suffering from the debilitating disease known as Geostigma. Once cured of his Geostigma, he easily dispatched the impressive Kadaj.<br/><br/>He also also a superb motorcyclist, being able to combat Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo while driving at extremely fast speeds. Cloud has also shown the ability to use various Magic through the power of Materia.Â <br/><br/> <h2>Analysis<br/></h2>Cloud's story is largely an Existential Bildungsroman. Cloud begins his life as a cheerful, but lonely youngster wishing to impress his only friend and romantic interest; Tifa Lockhart. He is demonised by his town for something he had no control over, causing him to feel somewhat worthless. Ultimately, this low self-worth caused Cloud to suffer an Existential crisis after the death of his friend Zack, who had asked Cloud to be his \"living legacy\". Cloud, rather than living his life honoring and remembering Zack, instead suffered a psychological breakdown and lived his life as Zack. <br/><br/>Cloud's personality continued to exist as fragmented pieces of consciousness, usually manifesting itself during dreams or times of great stress. Ultimately, Cloud rejects Zack's personality, and reaffirms his own existence. He is more reserved and retained his self-deprecating attitude, but he loved and protected his friends more fiercely after the ordeal, as it was him loving them not \"Zack\".",

She takes advantage of this shyness when both girls like the guy moving in across the hall in their apartment complex, pursuing him openly.  Jin does not know that her roommate's increasingly bizarre behavior of late is due to her realization that she is the latest in a long line of Snake Women, that her roommate is a murderer.</p>",

After a meeting she was given a costume and told to sit in a machine with cocoon sections. As she waited worrying of what was to come a woman named <a href=\"/sunswift/4005-43550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43550\">Sunswift</a> was flying from space heading for the machine. As she dove into the machine her powers radiated to Tracy and the others.</p><p>Once the machine had finished Tracy came out the machine and discovered her skin turned green. She was okay with what happened as a few of her friends weren't. Vandervecken then came and introduced Sunswift to Tracy and the others. Then all of a sudden the company's enemy was attacking four different places. Vandervecken told them what they had to do and told them were to go. Tracy was sent to California with <a href=\"/avatar/4005-43543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43543\">Avatar</a> to deal with a sea monster attacking the city. As they arrived they were attacked by the unknown enemy. SIlkie at first did not know what her powers were. But later figured out when trying to stop the horde of soldiers. After dealing with their enemy they had to deal with the sea monster. Silkie tried to see if she could control the monster but was whacked away by it, to which avatar thought was a strange idea. She then helped Avatar to tie up the creature. After the beast was dealt with they went back to Future Dyanmics.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-568419\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.30558276199804\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:30.6%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-568419\"><img alt=\"Tracy's Manta Form\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg 1021w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19859/568419-silkie__tracy_winters__picture_15.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Tracy's Manta Form</figcaption></figure><p>Tracy Winters is a skilled swimmer  breathe and dive at great depths.

    "description": "<p>Raj is an unassuming everyman who moves in across the hall from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43068\" href=\"/jessica-peterson/4005-43068/\" slug=\"jessica-peterson\">Jessica Peterson</a> and her roommate Jin.  The two girls joke about his appearance being an opportunity for the shy Jessica to begin to date in L.A.  Jin, though, is the first to snare Raj, to Jessica's dismay.  But Jessica - secretly becoming closer to the animal side of her persona, as passed down to every generation's Snake Woman - begins to make advances as well, seducing Raj while he is dating her roommate.<br/></p><p>Raj is not all that he seems, however.  Following Jin's confession that she saw Jessica transform into a Snake Woman after being attacked, he savagely kills her and positions her body as if she had actually hanged herself by a belt from a ceiling fan.  After Jin's death Jessica has a climactic confrontation with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43237\" href=\"/harker/4005-43237/\" slug=\"harker\">Harker</a>, which reveals that Raj has been working for <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43239\" href=\"/the-68/4060-43239/\" slug=\"the-68\">The 68</a> all along.  Though not one of them, he was placed near the suspected - and then confirmed - Snake Woman in order to better observe and manipulate her.<br/></p><p>Raj has a background of undisclosed and extensive military and personal combat training.  He is extremely vocal about his abilities once he is compromised - Jessica realizing that Jin was hanging from Raj's belt.  Though he is not one of The 68, because of his expertise, they hired him to manage the newest Snake Woman.</p>",
