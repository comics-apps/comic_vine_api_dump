    "description": "<h2>Origin<br /></h2><p>Jamal Afari was a vampire hunter in his youth, facing many enemies. Dracula was the most prominent of them. He quit at some point and started a career as a jazz horn player. He was good at his job but also acquired a drug habbit. A drug overdose had him hospitalized for a while. On a cold December night Afari was discharged from the hospital. He was attacked by a number of vampires who wanted to take advantage of this vampire hunter's weakened state. He received unexpected help from Eric Brooks (Blade), a nine-year-old orphan.  <br /></p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs<br /></h2><h3>Teaching Blade<br /></h3><p>Afari decided to turn a new leaf and started to teach the underage vampire hunter the secret of the trade. They moved together to Lady Vanity's brothel in London. Life lessons Eric learned there vampire hunting techniques, observation skills and looting the wealth of killed or escaped vampires. Afari was the closest thing to a father Blade ever had. But this period ended with a blunder by the student. Blade killed a man suffering from porphyria, thinking he was a vampire. The Scotland Yard was looking for the killer. Afari helped his student escape by sailing to the United States. Blade ewould end up alone in New York City.  <br /></p><h3>Death<br /></h3><p>A few years later Blade had to return to London, alerted by Lady Vanity that his mentor had gone missing. They both thought Afari had started using drugs again. They were wrong. Dracula had tracked down his old enemy and vampirized him. The aging vampire hunter was now a vampire himself. Blade tracked down Afari and the old man advised him to get away from him. Blade would not listen and Afari's blood lust got uncontrollable. Blade eventually killed Afari in self-defense.  <br /></p><h3>Ressurection<br /></h3><p>Afari would later be resurrected by Dracula who needed his knowledge of vampiric lore. Unwittingly Afari and Blade helped Dracula resurrect all the vampires who ever died. Afari was last seen reconciling with Blade and contemplating the unintended consequences of the spell. </p>",

Hammer told his assistant to call his minions in the Los Angeles area which included Afterburner, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4836\" href=\"/beetle/4005-4836/\">              Beetle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12709\" href=\"/whiplash/4005-12709/\">             Blacklash</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6299\" href=\"/boomerang/4005-6299/\">            Boomerang</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10222\" href=\"/spymaster/4005-10222/\">           Spymaster</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4808\" href=\"/blizzard/4005-4808/\">          Blizzard</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14451\" href=\"/cyclone/4005-14451/\">         Cyclone</a> to prepare an assault on Silver Sable and her crew. Hammer's minions ambushed Silver Sable and the Wild Pack inside a warehouse. Afterburner used her superhuman speed to pummel <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57015\" href=\"/powell/4005-57015/\"> Powell</a> with a flurry of punches but things started to get out of control when the gang members jumped into the fray. Afterburner knocked some gangsters on their asses and Hammer's minions retreated away in their transport. The speedster hasn't been seen since and the current whereabouts of Afterburner are unknown.      <br /></p><h2>Creation<br /></h2>Afterburner was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-17795\" href=\"/gregory-wright/4040-17795/\">     Gregory Wright</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-13742\" href=\"/steven-butler/4040-13742/\">    Steven Butler</a> in 1994 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4810\" href=\"/silver-sable-and-the-wild-pack/4050-4810/\">   Silver Sable &amp; The Wild Pack</a> # 21.<br /><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br /></h2>Afterburner possesses superhuman speed and has the ability to throw punches at her enemies multiple times per second.

    "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Walter Barrett acquired custody of the daughter he never met following the tragic death of her mother. He was ashamed of his daughter's mutant nature and demanded she not use her mutant abilities following her move from Venezuela to the United States. Barrett never afforded time for his daughter and instead his butler Derek Newton tended to her needs. When her father did not even take notice of her birthday, Sofia stormed one of his businesses and began to create an intense tornado within the complex, causing intense damage.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Walter Barret was created by Christina Weir, Nunzio DeFilippis and Keron Grant and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants-1-the-wind-knows-my-name/4000-107614/\">New Mutants Vol.2 issue 1</a>(2003).</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Mutant Daugther</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Sofia was arrested, Barrett refused to bail her out to teach her a lesson. When <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Moonstar</a> heard of Sofia's arrest on television, she recruited her to join the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Refusing due to the bad press it would bring, Barrett later gave in after Moonstar threatened to make the bad press even worse.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Derek would often try to visit Sofia while she attended the school and attempted to bring her father with him several times. Barrett has continued to show a lack of interest, even fleeing the scene while she was attacked by the mutant murdering team the <a href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\">Reavers</a>. Barrett's cowardice caused Derek to leave his job and decided to move closer to the school so he could visit Sofia.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Rehire the Help</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Barrett wanted to rehire Derek, he attended Parents Week at the Xavier Institute in an attempt to scheme his hired help back into service. When Sofia learned of the betrayal, her powers and her temper nearly went out of control and she had to be forcibly calmed by the telepathic mutant <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The two have not seen each other since. Sofia is currently known as the superheroine <a href=\"/renascence/4005-40537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40537\">Renascence</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ashley Guthrie was the son of Evan and Suzanne Guthrie and brother to Lucas Guthrie. The Guthries lived in Mount Healthy, Ohio and were seen by the community as validation that the 'American Dream' was attainable. Mr. Guthrie was a lawyer and Mrs. Guthrie was an accountant. Everything seemed perfect and pleasant for the Guthrie family.</p><p>As for Ashley, he was a peculiar child. Some say that he was born bad. He was extremely possessive of his belongings, so much to the point where other children would not be allowed to play with Ashley because they would always return home crying. One incident alleges Ashley killed his cat's litter of kittens because they were keeping him from playing with his pet.</p><p>With such a problem child, the Guthrie's marriage began to fall apart and culminated with the death of the two Guthrie children. The police received a phone call from Mr. Guthrie who says he bludgeoned Lucas to death and suffocated Ashley as he slept. With the police investigation and the media coverage, Evan couldn't handle it and hung himself in his cell. With the loss of her family, Suzanne suffered a nervous breakdown and was placed in a psychiatric hospital.</p><p>Later on, after nine kids had died in their sleep, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47906\" href=\"/cassie-hack/4005-47906/\" slug=\"cassie-hack\">Cassie Hack</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47905\" href=\"/vlad/4005-47905/\" slug=\"vlad\">Vlad</a> were called to Mount Healthy to investigate. The meet with a young man named Jason who tells them the Guthrie history and he believes Ashley has become a sleep-slasher since he died in his sleep. Cassie and Vlad agree to look into the mysterious deaths. Later that night, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56251\" href=\"/jason-michaels/4005-56251/\" slug=\"jason-michaels\">Jason</a> is visited by Ashley in his dreams and is killed by him.</p><p>Cassie visits Suzanne at the psychiatric facility and learns the truth behind the Guthrie murders. When Ashley wouldn't share his toy truck with his brother, Lucas took it away himself. Ashley was so angry that he grabbed the truck back and smashed it across Lucas' head and, without any reaction, went upstairs to take a nap. Distraught over what her devil child had done, Suzanne followed behind and smothered Ashley with his teddy bear. But Ashley hadn't died, his spirit lived on and haunted his parents' dreams until Mr. Guthrie was driven to commit suicide and Suzanne had to be institutionalized.</p><p>Cassie decides the best way to confront Ashley is on his turf, the Dreamscape, and has her friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54085\" href=\"/lisa-elsten/4005-54085/\" slug=\"lisa-elsten\">Lisa Elsten</a> use anesthesia to put Cassie to sleep. Ashley fights Cassie in her dreams and comes close to killing her more than once, but Cassie reveals she was just keeping the dead boy busy until the end of her nightmare came. Ashley finds out that every night Cassie's dreams end the same way - with Cassie being confronted by her dead slasher mother, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54082\" href=\"/lunch-lady/4005-54082/\" slug=\"lunch-lady\">Lunch Lady</a>. The dream Lunch Lady grabs Ashley and starts hacking away at him with a meat cleaver which ends Ashley's killing spree in Mount Healthy.</p><p>Ashley would appear again possessing a stuffed teddy bear. He followed Cassie and Vlad when they had been kidnapped by Emily Cristy, who had been hired by Ceutotech to grab her as well as some many slashers. The plan was to have Cassie and Vlad catch them so they could study slasher genes, hoping it would give them an edge in cosmetic applications. No one counted on Ashley coming and setting all the slashers free. He along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56252\" href=\"/acid-angel/4005-56252/\" slug=\"acid-angel\">Acid Angel</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56274\" href=\"/x-o/4005-56274/\" slug=\"x-o\">X-O</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56275\" href=\"/the-waking-man/4005-56275/\" slug=\"the-waking-man\">Waking Ma</a>n, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56273\" href=\"/mortimer-strick/4005-56273/\" slug=\"mortimer-strick\">Mortimer Strick</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56276\" href=\"/hibachi-devil/4005-56276/\" slug=\"hibachi-devil\">Hibachi Devil</a> worked, temporarily together to get weapons.</p><p>Eventually, besides killing many of the coworkers, some of the slashers killed each other. After getting injured by one of the slashers, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54139\" href=\"/emily-cristy/4005-54139/\" slug=\"emily-cristy\">Emily</a> took a serum to be one. She killed Ashley when he attempted to kill Cassie and bought them some time, while she was still human. Ashley's body was destroyed in the fire. But his soul was still very active.</p><p>Using his dream powers, he connected to a psychic named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55366\" href=\"/muffy-joworski/4005-55366/\" slug=\"muffy-joworski\">Muffy Joworski</a> and manipulated her visions to make Cassie look like the murders in every place Cassie had taken down a slasher. With his influence, Muffy got Cassie arrested, but it came at a price. Ashley's hold over Muffy became more powerful and he possesses her body in order to go after Cassie. He soon enlists the aid of banished rocker Six Sixx in order to do it. However, he accidentally unleashes more creatures from a hell dimension who capture and torture the group.</p><p>When Sixx is separated from the group, he makes a deal with the Neflords. After having his powers recharged in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55978\" href=\"/nef/4020-55978/\" slug=\"nef\">Nef</a>, returns to free his fellow hostages. He then returns to Nef with Muffy/Ashley as a payment to his masters for his newly restored abilities. Although Cassie objects, not wanting Muffy to suffer. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54088\" href=\"/six-sixx/4005-54088/\" slug=\"six-sixx\">Sixx</a> says the old lady was practically dead as Ashley had full control now.</p><p>Ashley may have died, along with Muffy, in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-36169\" href=\"/hackslash-annual-2010-murder-messiah/4050-36169/\" slug=\"hackslash-annual-2010-murder-messiah\">Hack/Slash Annual 2010: Murder Messiah issue</a> as the Neflords used their powers and Muffy's womb to create Stillborn. Ironically, Stillborn fails in his mission to kill Cassie and is literally torn apart by fans when he murdered a teen idol.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gertude is a 38-year-old, past-her-prime groupie and self-proclaimed \"original\" Acid Washed fan. Gertude has been in love with musice ever since she can remember, her main dream is to someday be the love object of a musican who would write a song dedicated to her. Most likely the reason why she hangs around many bands, during her youth she met many future stars including Meat Loaf. Despite her age, she tries to sometimes flash her breasts to gain attention. This however now doesn't get her many places. <br /> <br />After Acid Washed's concert, it appears Gertude has no idea or memory of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54088\" href=\"/six-sixx/4005-54088/\">Six Sixx </a>taking the virgin girls into the Nef World. When she tries to get back stage, she's rejected. Hurt by her rejection, she goes to a bar to drink her sorrows, which is where she runs into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47905\" href=\"/vlad/4005-47905/\">Vlad</a>. Vlad, although being a virgin, is a male and according to one of Six's bandmates was too big to go with their sacrifices. Thus, leaving Cassie and their new friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54087\" href=\"/georgia-peaches/4005-54087/\">Georgia Peaches </a>in the Nef world being prepared for sacrifice. Vlad was in some way down as well, he was vunerable to Six's attacks because he was a virgin. And was being judged by the women because of his looks. <br /> <br />Vlad sees a drunken Gertude and kindly decides to walk her home. During the walk, Gertude explains that in her past, she did sleep with a few of the musicans but soberly explains she wouldn't have if she truly didn't believe they didn't love her. She also confides to him that she worries, she'll never find real love. She believes Vlad understands this because of his looks. Feeling a bit hurt, Vlad decides to leave but gets a surprise when Gertude kisses him and soon have sex in her apartment. <br /> <br />The morning after, Gertude offers to help him and is able to get into Six's dressing room, using a \"fan\". After a long battle with Six and his bandmates, Vlad is able to defeat him. Using Six's guitar they are able to release Cassie and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54087\" href=\"/georgia-peaches/4005-54087/\">Georgia </a>before the entity attacks them. Gertude gives Six her own personal revenge by flashing him and then taking his guitar, she states his songs were terrible and kicks him into his verison of Hell. As Cassie and Vlad leave, Cassie curiously asks if he's got a girlfriend now. <br /> <br />Vlad calmly states that Gertude said she's married to music, but he's always welcome if he wants to be intimate. Gertude makes another appearance in </p> <p><a data-ref-id=\"4000-153971\" href=\"/hackslash-the-series-mind-killer-part-1/4000-153971/\">Hack/Slash: The Series #21 - Mind Killer</a>. Cassie, Georgia(who was traveling with them) and Vlad spy her on the road. She apparently was having dreams about her musicans. However, Cassie and Vlad see it as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54132\" href=\"/ashley-guthrie/4005-54132/\">Ashley Guthrie </a>trying to use Gertude to find Six's guitar. While Vlad and Cassie try calmly to talk her into giving it to them, Gertude tries charming Vlad by saying she wants to keep it as a momento of Vlad. Cassie, not in the mood, quickly starts arguing with her. <br /> <br />The argument soon becomes a catfight between her, Georgia, and Gertude. As Vlad breaks-up their fight, all of them are quickly surrounded by the police who takes all of them into custody. Soon Ashley who takes possession of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55366\" href=\"/muffy-joworski/4005-55366/\">Muffy Joworski</a>, crashes into the station with a police car and kills any one in his way. He soon finds Six's guitar and releases him, but all soon see he brought some univinted guests. The bizarre creatures take control of the dead officers' bodies and take the entire group hostage, including Ashley/Muffy and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54088\" href=\"/six-sixx/4005-54088/\">Six Sixx</a>.<br />  <br />As they do, the creatures torment Gertude, Cassie, and the others with their worst fears in their minds. However, Six quickly breaks free and soon returns to the Nef World to restore his powers. He quickly returns to save the hostages and also to take Cassie Hack. But Ashley/Muffy behaves childishly, wanting only to kill her. Seeing he's become unreasonable, Six knocks Ashley out and takes him as payment for his masters. After the carnage is over, Gertude is immediately guilt-stricken by the deaths that have happened, blaming herself for not listening to Cassie. <br /> <br />As she laters cries to Vlad for comfort, Vlad reminds her that a lot of people cared for her. And that he cared for her, Cassie over hears them and smiles a soft smile for Vlad. Gertude would make a minor appearance in <a data-ref-id=\"4000-159736\" href=\"/hackslash-the-series-double-feature-mad-mad-mailman-blood-blower/4000-159736/\">Hack/Slash: The Series ##23 - Double Feature Mad, Mad Mailman &amp; Blood Blower</a>, bringing food at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54086\" href=\"/chris-krank/4005-54086/\">Chris's </a>and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54085\" href=\"/lisa-elsten/4005-54085/\">Lisa'</a>s home for a Christmas get-together with Vlad and Georgia. And gives Georgia some kind advice on love.</p>",

    "deck": "Former Ms. America and nude centerfold, Emily Cristy became the head of Ceutotech, Inc's research division and came into conflict with Cassie Hack after the company abducted Vlad. ",
    "description": "<p>Emily Cristy is a former Ms. America title holder who later posed nude for 'Girlie' magazine. Afterwards, Cristy entered the pharmaceutical industry and eventually became head of Ceutotech, Inc's research division. In order for the company to remain competitive, the research and development department was encouraged to look for anything that may give them an edge including <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55940\" href=\"/slashers/4060-55940/\" slug=\"slashers\">slasher</a> genetics. Seeing as how slashers were able to recover from a variety of physical damage and even complete bodily shutdown, the medical and cosmetic applications seemed undeniable.</p><p>Ceutotech hired a team of professionals to capture slashers for their research. Within the Regenerative Research Division, the company held slashers such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56273\" href=\"/mortimer-strick/4005-56273/\" slug=\"mortimer-strick\">Mortimer Strick</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56274\" href=\"/x-o/4005-56274/\" slug=\"x-o\">X-O</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56275\" href=\"/the-waking-man/4005-56275/\" slug=\"the-waking-man\">Waking Man</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56276\" href=\"/hibachi-devil/4005-56276/\" slug=\"hibachi-devil\">Hibachi Devil</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56252\" href=\"/acid-angel/4005-56252/\" slug=\"acid-angel\">Acid Angel</a>. However, despite the time and effort, the company has only been able to capture those five in two years. The company hoped that, due to Cassie's experience and knowledge, they would be able to capture slashers more efficiently. However, when the dream-slasher <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54132\" href=\"/ashley-guthrie/4005-54132/\" slug=\"ashley-guthrie\">Ashley Guthrie</a> returned for revenge on Cassie, he freed the captured slashers and set them loose in the facility.</p><p>During the course of the attack, Emily tried to save a sample of the liquid chemical derived from slasher DNA. Vlad tried to take the vial knowing only bad things would come of it's use, but Emily ran off only to be stabbed by Acid Angel. Not wanting to die, Emily used the chemical on herself and became a slasher. Slowly losing her mind, Emily held off the freed slashers long enough for Cassie and Vlad to escape the building.</p><p>Emily was caught in the explosion which destroyed the facility. When the fire department responded to the emergency, they spotted Emily Cristy. Her body badly burnt, she attacked the fireman who tried to help her and walked off into the night. She was later captured and brought to the Crane Institute, a scientific organization also doing research on slashers. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54140\" href=\"/dr-turek/4005-54140/\" slug=\"dr-turek\">David Turek</a>, a scientist at the Crane Institute, had had a childhood crush on Emily Cristy but was dismissed from the team when his infatuation clouded his judgement. Returning to the Institute in secret, David released Emily in hopes of her returning his affections. Cutting his hand, David let his blood fall on Emily's body which awakened the woman slasher. Killing David and taking his skin, Emily escaped and made her way to the east coast.</p><p>In Brookline, Massachusetts at Franco-Belle College for Women of which Emily was an alumnus, Emily integrated herself into the student body, having taken the skin of a student named Eliza and joined the secret sorority known as the Tub Club, within which she was also involved during her college years. Unknown to Cristy, Cassie and Vlad were called to investigate the murders taking place around the campus. Gathering the Tub Club members in the caves below the school, Emily held a ritual ceremony which merged all the girls' skins with hers granting her ascension into a being called the Ourobouros. Cassie and Vlad confronted her and after an extended fight, Cristy was finally killed when Vlad impaled her on a stalagmite.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dr. White worked for the government many years ago and one of his colleagues was Dr. Jack Hack; Cassie Hack's father. During their work together, they were arranged to study slashers, among them was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56274\" href=\"/x-o/4005-56274/\" slug=\"x-o\">X-O</a>. They were basically to figure out what made slashers tick and triggered them to kill, how to control, and also how to reduplicate their regenerative powers. They were even set to inspect potential slashers, one of which was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54082\" href=\"/lunch-lady/4005-54082/\" slug=\"lunch-lady\">Delilah Cordero</a>. Dr. White would often joke that Jack was lucky to work with her, as she sounded pretty. He would have no clue, his colleague was involved with Delilah romantically and had fallen in love with her.</p><p>While the government wanted him and Jack to find ways to make the slashers, living weapons. Jack, however, wanted to cure them, after falling in love with Delilah. His colleague would eventually go AWOL on them and runaway with Delilah to live a normal family life with her. Dr. White was not shown to have contact with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55365\" href=\"/jack-hack/4005-55365/\" slug=\"jack-hack\">Jack</a> after he departed and was on the run from the government. Dr. White began working at the Crane Institute, once again, studying slashers.</p><p>A new one was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54139\" href=\"/emily-cristy/4005-54139/\" slug=\"emily-cristy\">Emily Cristy</a>, who had turned herself into one to avoid death. Dr. White would find a disturbing surprise when he discovered one of his scientist, Dr. David Turek, alone with a contained Emily. It became clear <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54140\" href=\"/dr-turek/4005-54140/\" slug=\"dr-turek\">Turek</a>, was too obsessed with her to continue working in his studies. He immediately fired David, but it would be a little too late. As a last minute attempt to be with her, David opened her container. Cutting his hand, David let his blood fall on he body which awakened the woman slasher. She killed David and took his skin. Emily escaped and made her way to the east coast.</p><p>With her gone and David dead, it was obvious Dr. White would have to go hunting for the slasher before more damage could be done. White's team would locate her in Brookline, Massachusetts at Franco-Belle College for Women. Emily integrated herself into the student body, having taken the skin of a student named Eliza and joined the secret sorority known as the Tub Club.</p><p>During this search, White would meet his former colleague's daughter <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47906\" href=\"/cassie-hack/4005-47906/\" slug=\"cassie-hack\">Cassie Hack</a>. She and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47905\" href=\"/vlad/4005-47905/\" slug=\"vlad\">Vlad</a> had been called to investigate the mysterious murders on campus. Eventually, White was killed in their travels down the caves below the school, where Emil had now merged all the girls' skins with her.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Historical Novel</h2><p>Ivanhoe is the titular protagonist of an historical fiction novel by Walter Scott, first published in 1819. The novel was highly successful and spawned a revival of interest in the <a href=\"/middle-ages/4015-56043/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56043\">Middle Ages</a> in audiences of Europe and the United States, part of the wider Romanticism movement.</p><p>Ivanhoe was born in the Kingdom of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/england/4020-55794/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\">England</a> in the late 12th century. The country was ruled by the Plantagenet dynasty and the Norman nobility loyal to them. Ivanhoe's father Cedric the Saxon was among the last surviving members of Saxon nobility (the proper Saxon name was Cerdic. Scott made a misspelling when including it in the novel. Ridiculed at the time because there was no such name in the English language, the novel was popular enough that people actually started giving the children the \"wrong\" name. A century later few would blink at someone named Cedric).</p><p>Cedric planned a Saxon restoration in England, placing his hopes in his ward <a href=\"/lady-rowena/4005-63212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63212\">Lady Rowena</a>. Rowena was among the last descendants of the old Saxon Royal lines. Cedric planned to find a husband of similar origin for her and them promote them as pretenders to the royal throne. Ivanhoe did not share his father's views and wanted Rowena for himself. His father felt betrayed and exiled him. Ivanhoe apparently then joined Richard I in the Third Crusade.</p><p>The novel deals with Ivanhoe's return of the Crusade and his involvement in a series of plots instigated by ambitious noblemen who were taking advantage of Richard's continued absence. In the process he revives his relationship with Rowena, gains a second love interest in the person of Rebeca, a Jewish healer accused of witchcraft and befriends both <a href=\"/robin-hood/4005-14335/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14335\">Robin Hood</a> and a mysterious Black Knight. The Knight eventually turns up being Richard I in disguise and ready to reclaim his throne.</p><p>The novel ends with Richard back on the throne and winning support by Normans and Saxons alike, Ivanhoe and Rowena marrying. Rebecca has been proven innocent but leaves with her father for Granada, <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/spain/4020-55776/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55776\">Spain</a>. Rebecca happens to be among the most popular characters of the novel. At the time of first publication of its sympathetic treatment of Jews was groundbreaking. But the marriage of a young high-born man with a Jewess would be unthinkable. Later generations of readers find it disappointing that Rowena gets a happy ending and Rebecca self-exile.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Comics</h3><h4>Pantheon Character</h4><p>In the universe of the Pantheon storyline, the character named Ivanhoe comes from the United Kingdom, living in a private Island somewhere off the coast of <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/scotland/4020-55911/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55911\">Scotland</a>.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><h4>Defender of the Crown</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/defender-of-the-crown/3030-5773/\">Defender of the Crown</a> is a strategy computer game developed by Cinemaware and released for the Commodore Amiga in 1986. In 1987 it was ported to DOS, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Macintosh and finally, the Apple IIGS in 1988. It was later ported to the CD-i.</p><p>Set in England in 1149 during the Middle Ages where, following the death of the king, the player assumes the role of a Saxon (Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wulfric the Wild) and tries to fight off the Norman hordes and wrestle for control of England and can ask for help from Robin Hood. Depending on the version of the game, Ivanhoe and the others will have a rating of either Excellent, Good, or Average in Leadership, Swordplay and <a href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/jousting/4015-56992/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56992\">Jousting</a>.</p>",

Hoping to escape from all plant life, he moved to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" slug=\"gotham-city\">Gotham City</a>. After finding that Gotham City had plenty of trees and plants, he donned a toxin suit and spread herbicides and defoliants throughout the city parks. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1697\" href=\"/poison-ivy/4005-1697/\" slug=\"poison-ivy\">Poison Ivy</a> learned of this, she broke out of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\">Arkham</a> and tracked him down. Before giving Allergent a lethal kiss,<a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\"> Batman</a> interrupted them. After a brief fight, Batman managed to subdue Ivy. Allergent managed to get away but he was soon captured by<a data-ref-id=\"4005-25328\" href=\"/lockup/4005-25328/\" slug=\"lockup\"> Lock-Up</a>, a vigilante villain who believed criminals should be given harsh sentences.

He is a fairly laid back man who nonetheless takes his duty very seriously. He is slow to befriend someone, but once he does he is fiercely loyal, though he tends to have a hard time dealing with more boisterous personalities.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Izuru Kira was born to a lesser noble clan, and thus he is a pure blood Shinigami who seemed destined for a seated position. During his training at the academy he befriended <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47619\" href=\"/momo-hinamori/4005-47619/\">Momo Hinamori</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43022\" href=\"/renji-arabai/4005-43022/\">Renji Arabai</a>, and he shares a friendly rivalry with Renji. His closest friend however is likely <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54176\" href=\"/rangiku-matsumoto/4005-54176/\">Rangiku Matsumoto</a>, whom he often shares drinks and advice with.</p><p>When Gin defected from soul society, he was torn between loyalties to friends and his captain. In the end he chose his captain, and raised his blade to fend off his childhood friend Hinamori. Though he apologized afterwards, he has been deeply troubled with clashing blades with his childhood friend, and calls himself a monster. This is actually a very bi part of Kira's personality: it is not just now that he is apologizing. He often apologizes to his peers for perceived sleights, whether he has slighted others or not: he is a person who tends to keep his gaze low, perhaps from a low self esteem. This quality of his was exploited by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42858\" href=\"/gin-ichimaru/4005-42858/\">Gin Ichimaru</a> his ex-captain, and it in fact makes him vulnerable to anyone who can exploit this quality of his.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>As a shinigami, Kira is proficient in the use of Kidou magic, and possesses the shinigami's air-walking ability, along with the capacity to purify the souls of those he slays with his zanpaktou, along with shunpo (short range high speed movement).</p><h2>Zapakuto</h2><p>Kira's zanpakutō is named Wabisuke, which roughly translates to \"miserable man\" or \"apology\"</p><p>Its shikai release command is intoned as \"raise your head, Wabisuke!\" When activated, the blade loses its curve and gains a square shaped head which looks like a hook. This has two effects.</p><p>Firstly, the blade itself becomes far stronger and strikes with more force.</p><p>Secondly, its Shikai ability is present in the blade itself, unlike many Shikai which fire energy blasts or otherwise have flashy effects. Everything hit with Wabisuke doubles in weight, and the effect is cumulative. For example, the first strike on an opponents sword (whether hit or blocking) doubles the weight. Then, a second strike doubles it again. The potential of this is limitless, but with a small number of strikes to an opponents blade usually renders them unable to move.</p><p>As a further example, lets take an opponent wielding a 10lb sword. Kira with a single strike (slow and aimed to be blocked) strikes the blade which is raised i defense, the sword doubles to 20lb weight. Kira than strikes twice more with his agility and speed, as he is a great swordsman. The weight doubles to 40ln then 80lb. The opponent is now very slow, holding a sword that weighs 80b, so to be sure Kira strikes again, doubling it to 160lb, then again to 320lb. By this point, most opponents cannot lift their swords and are brought to their knees by the weight of their weapon.</p><p>This is perhaps a poetic effect of Kira's weapon. Its style looks like he is making his opponents bow their heads in apology for a past decision as it brings his opponents to their knees before him. The effect is not limited to weapons, he could do the same by merely striking someone with the flat of the blade twice, doubling the weight of their body, then doubling it again. The secondary reason for Kira's swords style was shown in this manner. By striking an opponent four times and making their body sixteen times as heavy, he forces them to fall and either lie or kneel, hardly able to move. The hook end of his blade then shows its gruesome function: it is a beheading blade able to take off a fallen opponents head by holding the razored hook beneath his opponents necks and lifting. Kira has shown himself remorseless with this, beheading defenseless opponents who were pleading for mercy.</p>",

His form remains the same, the extra bodies cohabit the same space. He can siphon their abilities as well. If he absorbs enough people he can gain extra powers such as heat vision too. Whenever he is attacked, he simply \"assigns damage\" to one of his victims. Victims that die from taking too much damage are expelled from his body (and remain dead). As one can surmise, Chaos Nation can be an extremely dangerous threat in a populous area. Fighting Chaos Nation is a steep toll of lost lives.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origins </h2>Raphael <a href=\"///\">  Zoran</a> is the son of \"The Great Zoran\", a mentalist who performed at a carnival. His <a href=\"///\">  mother</a> also worked at the carnival, as an assistant to his father. \"The Great Zoran\" didn't actually possess any psychic abilities, and the entire act was staged. What he did possess was a thirst for alcohol and a willingness to take out his frustrations on his wife and son. One night while he was abusing his wife, he suddenly found himself surrounded by what appeared to be demons. He realized what was really happening at the same time as his wife: she actually did possess psychic powers, and in a moment of desperation, she had generated illusions as a subconscious defense. She was terrified for having done it, and withdrew them immediately, by the Great Zoran was even more furious. He was angry that she had powers he had always wanted, and he realized that it was her powers which had made the show a success. He attacked and savagely beat her to death. Raphael witnessed the whole thing. <br/> <br/><h2>The Show must go on   </h2>The Great Zoran continued his act with Raphael now acting as his assistant. His father suspected that Raphael, too, might possess some psychic powers, but could not bring them to the surface. The two grew to hate each other, kept together by their bond of mutual resentment. At age 15, Raphael's powers did surface: He could cast illusions and bend the wills of others to his. Raphael used his powers to take control of the relationship with his father, taking over the act, and eventually casting him aside. Raphael's act was a tremendous success, and he eventually purchased the carnival. Despite his successes, Raphael felt empty, enjoying only the non-reality of the illusions he created. <br/>  <br/><h2>Birth of a monster</h2>Two of Satan's demons came to Earth, in search of a victim to possess, and they saw the empty Raphael as a perfect target. They entered his form, but in the end, his psychic powers enabled him to take control of the demons, trapping them in his body, and using their powers for himself. That night he slew his father, and vanished, seemingly without a trace.  <p>Zoran, now taking the identity of the Possessor, traveled to a Navajo tribe in Arizona. He sought out the tribe's shaman and commanded the shaman to train him in the ways of mysticism. The shaman recognized the evil in the Possessor, and refused. Zoran, however, knew that the shaman would train a young brave, and decided to return and take the knowledge from that brave.<br/> <br/>Zoran then traveled the world, seeking out mystics of all types of sects, but they all refused him as well. He finally procured several rare and ancient mystic tomes and used them to train himself. He knew his abilities were but a fraction of what they could be, but when he tried to increase them on his own, he was driven mad by the uncontrolled power unleashed from the demons inside him. He regained his senses after an unknown period of time, and found himself outside of the mansion at Fire Lake, the home of Daimon Hellstrom, the Son of Satan (who was working in St. Louis at the time). Zoran entered the mansion, and made it his own. As he recovered his strength, he read the diaries of Victoria Wingate Hellstrom, and learned of the true nature and history of the mansion. Zoran decided to test Hellstrom to see if the stories were true, and if they were, to use him to become the Lord of Hell. <br/><br/>The Possessor defaced the Fire Lake mansion. The Possessor invaded Hell, tormenting the demons he encountered there. <br/>The Son of Satan returned to Fire Lake and encountered the Possessor, who assaulted him with a series of illusions. He revealed his true nature, told Hellstrom that he would destroy him in the future, take over his father's realm of Hell, and then vanished. He teleported to Arizona, where he found the young Navajo brave engaged in a vision quest. The Possessor slew the brave's shaman, transformed the brave into Nightfire, and then enslaved the brave and his tribe. <br/><br/>Hellstrom tracked the Possessor to Arizona, and made his way to the local portal to Hell. There he found some of Satan's legions, including Baphomet, as well as the Possessor and the tribe he was controlling. The Possessor absorbed the soul of Hellstrom, taking control of his powers as well to prepare for his assault on Hell. <br/><br/>Zoran, with Nightfire and his tribe at his side attacked Baphomets and the demons of Hell, eventually drawing out Satan himself to the struggle. However, this was the Possessor's plan all along, to lure Satan to Earth, out of his domain in which he was virtually all-powerful. With the realm of Hell devoid of a leader, the Possessor transported himself through the portal and attempted to take it for himself. Satan returned and confronted him, but Daimon then fought back, allowing his own darksoul to emerge within the Possessor. Its powerful energies consumed the Possessor from the inside out, and he exploded in a burst of flames. <br/></p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The Possessor was mutant that could generate convincing illusions, read the minds, and influence the thoughts of others. After absorbing the demons, he gained a great degree of magical power, although he lacked the training to properly utilize it. He could teleport, project blasts of fire, mutate others, absorb the souls and bodies of others, access magical portals, etc. The limits of his abilities were not seen. He could increase his power by absorbing and controlling others, even a being as power as the Son of Satan. He grafted three crystals to his right palm: these were sparkling, red, crystals he used to use in his stage act.     <br/><br/></p>",

    "deck": "Rangiku Matsumoto is the Lieutenant of the Soul Society's 13 Squads tenth division working with Hitsugaya Toshiro and previously with Isshin Kurosaki. Her Zanpakuto is called: Haineko and it's abilities envelops it's target in ashes. She has a special relationship with Gin Ichimaru, the former captain of the Soul Society's Third Division of the 13 Divisions. She also inspired Hitsugaya into becoming a Soul Reaper to help protect his loved ones. She is drinking buddies with Shunsui Kyoraku.",
    "description": "<h2><b>Appearance &amp; Personality</b></h2><ul><li>Birthday: 29 September</li><li>Hair: Strawberry Blonde</li><li>Eyes: Blue</li><li>Height: 5'8\" (172cm)</li><li>Weight: 126 lbs</li></ul><p>Rangiku Matsumoto is the most attractive woman in soul society, and she seems unconsciously aware of it. She possesses beautiful strawberry-blond hair and clear innocent eyes. She is also famed amongst shinigami for her overly large endowments: an entrancing pair of massive, voluptuous breasts, which she often uses to her advantage over her male peers. Personality-wise she is probably the most outgoing person in bleach, and is usually the first one to break an uncomfortable silence to raise the spirits of her companions in a tense spot. She has a very unique relationship with her captain <a href=\"/toshiro-hitsugaya/4005-46357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46357\">Toshiro Hitsugaya</a>, in that he is too young to appreciate her womanly charms, something she often teases him about. He often gets angry at her, but this never lasts for long. In fact the pair often play the role of comedy relief in this regard.</p><p>She has a very strange taste in food, and will often sample things that nobody else will touch. She is also a very strong drinker, and can hold her alcohol better than most of her male peers. She often is shown to have many stashes of drink around her home and workplace, with <a href=\"/toshiro-hitsugaya/4005-46357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46357\">Toshiro Hitsugaya</a> getting angry at her whenever he discovers one of her hidden stashes of bottles. She wears her clothes a little loosely, often revealing her cleavage. She wears a necklace whose significance is unknown, and a pink scarf round her shoulders. In addiction, she wears her vice captains armband tied to her sash, as opposed to her arm.</p><p>When it comes to work, she is a slacker. She often is late with paperwork and interrupts her peers who are working, including her captain, Hitsugaya. She often seems self-centered and casually complains about others faults, for example that they are 'working too hard and need to relax', but deep down she is very compassionate. When others are upset, she is usually the first one to offer a caring hug or words, revealing her maternal side.</p><p>She is known to be close friends with <a href=\"/izuru-kira/4005-54162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54162\">Izuru Kira</a>, whom she often shares a drink with, and <a href=\"/momo-hinamori/4005-47619/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47619\">Momo Hinamori</a> whom she tries to comfort over the betrayal of her captain Aizen. Controversially she is also known to be friends with <a href=\"/gin-ichimaru/4005-42858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42858\">Gin Ichimaru</a>. In fact, she is the only one that he has shown a touch of compassion for, and is the only one to break his care-free facade.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Not much is known about her history pre-soul society arc. She is known to have once had her life saved by <a href=\"/gin-ichimaru/4005-42858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42858\">Gin Ichimaru</a> as a child. This has led her to consider him a close friend, and she is very hurt when he is revealed to be a traitor. When he saved her, Gin asked her when her birthday was. She revealed that she was an orphan, and had always been alone: she did not know the day her birthday was. Gin replied that if that was the case, then her birthday should be celebrated on the day they met: the day she was not alone any more.</p><h3>Soul Society Arc</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/97299/3340647-bleach-1587764.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3340647\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5626666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/97299/3340647-bleach-1587764.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3340647\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97299/3340647-bleach-1587764.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/97299/3340647-bleach-1587764.jpg 750w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97299/3340647-bleach-1587764.jpg 614w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-width=\"614\"></a></figure><p>Rangiku comes off as a lazy alcoholic in her first appearance. She is apparently always late to the meeting of vice-captains with Toshiro always having to find and wake her from her afternoon naps. Rangiku's demeanor changes once she learns a real threat is upon all Soul Society. Toshiro and Rangiku take it upon themselves to investigate the murder of Captain Aizen. She is forced to restrain Momo after attempting to kill Gin and fights his vice captain Kira. When Toshiro is pit against Gin. Rangiku is forced to side with her captain after Gin attempts to kill Momo. When a message reveals Rukia's execution was going down ahead of schedule. Toshiro and Rangiku go to consult Central 46, a group of nobles and judges that authorize legal matters over all Soul Society. She is horrified that every single member of Central 46 has been slaughtered. Toshiro determines the members had been dead for over a couple of days or even longer. Rangiku and Toshiro wonder who has been making the legal decrees since the arrival of Ichigo and who ordered the capture of Rukia. Kira reveals himself and becomes a suspect in the matter. Rangiku goes to duel with Kira and demands an explanation. The duel turns as Kira reveals his ability to increase the weight of whatever he hits with his Wabisuke. Rangiku doesn't care since her Haineko's ability is to turn into ash and act as microscopic blades. Kira reveals everything and Rangiku departs with Toshiro to help halt the execution of Rukia. They arrive to find <a href=\"/ichigo/4005-42468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42468\">Ichigo</a> has saved Rukia and Aizen is preparing to leave with Gin and Tousen. Gin apologizes to Rangiku and was afraid she couldnt follow him to <a href=\"/hueco-mundo/4020-55824/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55824\">Hueco Mundo</a>. Rangiku is heartbroken and consoled by Kira of all people. She decides to drown her sorrows in liquor with him.</p><h3>Arrancar Invasion</h3><p>Rangiku is among the Shinigami sent to help Ichigo protect <a href=\"/karakura-town/4020-55823/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55823\">Karakura</a> from the Arrancar, hollows with the ability of shinigami. Toshiro and Rangiku live with <a href=\"/orihime-inoue/4005-43019/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43019\">Orihime</a> until it is time to fight. She finds that her and Orihime have a lot in common sharing the same taste in food. Soon <a href=\"/grimmjow-jeagerjaques/4005-51667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51667\">Grimmjow</a> arrives with his fraccion to attack anyone with a strong spiritual force. Nakeem Greendina picks Rangiku to face off with. He dominates over Rangiku as her attacks have no effect. This doesn't last as Rangiku and other shinigami have their spiritual seal limitors removed in declaration of war. Nakeem felt he had nothing to fear in Rangiku's power increase. He tells his Sonido would allow him to out maneuver the woman. Rangiku ends it by using Flash Step (aka Shunpo),the Shinigami's method of speed increase to kill Nakeem. Rangiku later joins all the shinigami to face <a href=\"/luppi/4005-56780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56780\">Luppi</a>. She is too weak and nearly killed when Urahara comes to save the day.</p><h3>Fake Karakura Town</h3><p>Aizen's plan was revealed and was set to kill all the people of Karakura to create the King's Key. Rangiku stands at the ready with others as Aizen comes with the top three Espada and their fraccion. Rangiku boldly offers to face all three of Harribel's fraccion <a href=\"/mila-rose/4005-58656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58656\">Mila-Rose</a>, <a href=\"/sun-sun/4005-58657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58657\">Sunsun</a>,and <a href=\"/apache/4005-58655/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58655\">Apache</a>. Rangiku engages the trio and plays on their emotions. Apache and Mila-Rose fall for it until Sunsun brings them back to the matter at hand. It is too late as Rangiku uses Haineko to create a whirlwind of sharp ash around the trio. Apache breaks free and begins to clash with an exhausted Rangiku. Momo comes to help out and forces Apache to rejoin her comrades. Rangiku is more worried if Momo was still mentally and unstable. Momo wanted Toshiro to save Aizen before the Arrancar Invasion Arc. Rangiku finds that Momo genuinely wants to help her as Toshiro's lieutenant. Rangiku and Momo fight together but Rangiku doesn't forget how Momo keeps mentioning Captain Aizen. Momo injures Mila-Rose and the others to force a resureccion. They unite their powers to severe their left arms to form the monstrous Allon. Rangiku is helpless as once complete Allon is behind her. Momo looks as Rangiku is missing a huge chunk of her right waist. Rangiku and Momo are aided by Kira, Iba, and <a href=\"/shuhei-hisagi/4005-56787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56787\">Shuhe</a>i. She is incapacitated for the rest of the arc.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Rangiku Matsumoto is a Shinigami, and therefore possesses the normal powers for their kind: Kidou magic and air walking ability. On the real world they are also able to phase through walls as spirit-beings.</p><h2>Zanpaktou</h2><p>Rangiku Matsumoto's Zanpakuto is named Haineko (Ash Cat). Its hand-guard is in the shape of a cats head and the blade is straight and looks to be a Wakazashi (short sword). Haineko is personified as a cat girl and is just as lazy as her owner.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902474-vlcsnap_790670.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902474\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902474-vlcsnap_790670.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902474\"><img alt=\"Haineko avatar\" src=\"http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19373/902474-vlcsnap_790670.png\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902474-vlcsnap_790670.png 510w, http://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19373/902474-vlcsnap_790670.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Haineko avatar</figcaption></figure><p>Its special ability is named 'Growl' or properly intoned \"Growl, Haineko!\". The swords blade crumbles to dust / ash and is becomes a thin cloud that is under the control of Matsumoto. Far from being useless, this cloud is extremely lethal and is able to cut through stone or metal with ease, almost as if it disintegrates anything it touches. It moves extremely fast and she can return it back into the blade of her sword at will. She is also able to form it into the shape of an actual large cat, which she can have attack her opponents as a feline companion.</p>",

    "deck": "Hydro is a member of the Lin Kuei and an ally of Sub-Zero. Hydro was a high ranking assassin who had mastered control over water giving him a great many abilities. He was slain by Scorpion during his vendetta against Sub-Zero and the Lin Kuei.",
    "description": "<h2>Pre Mortal Kombat</h2><p>Hydro's past is shrouded in mystery like most members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-54158\" href=\"/lin-kuei/4060-54158/\" slug=\"lin-kuei\">Lin Kuei</a>. It is possible he was kidnapped as a child and raised by the clan as most new recruits were.

His training allowed Hydro to become a master over the element of water and he became a noted swordsman as well. He was allowed to follow Sub-Zero to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55787\" href=\"/outworld/4020-55787/\" slug=\"outworld\">Outworld</a> for the Mortal Kombat tournament there. During these events Hydro was slaughtered by the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55038\" href=\"/netherealm/4020-55038/\" slug=\"netherealm\">Netherealm</a> spectre <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42243\" href=\"/scorpion/4005-42243/\" slug=\"scorpion\">Scorpion</a> in his vengence against Sub-Zero for killing him and against the Lin Kuei for the massacre of his family and clan.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930434-comicbookcutout3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930434\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1620879120879\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930434-comicbookcutout3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930434\"><img alt=\"Hydro of the Lin Kuei\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100757/1930434-comicbookcutout3.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930434-comicbookcutout3.png 364w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100757/1930434-comicbookcutout3.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Hydro of the Lin Kuei</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'0''</li><li><b>Weight:</b> Unknown</li><li><b>Nationality:</b> <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\" href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" slug=\"earth\">Earthrealm</a> (Possible <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\" href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" slug=\"japan\">Japanese</a>)</li><li><b>Martial Art:</b> Unknown (Possible Ninjutsu)</li><li><b>Weapons:</b> Twin Katana</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Hydro was considered to be one of the Lin Kuei's top assassins, He possessed advanced martial art skills and could hold his own against most opponents. He was an avid swordsman and carried at least two katana across his back indicting a possible Japanese origin. His main power came in the manipulation over water. Hydro could shoot water at his foes with enough force to knock them back, or make the water cold enough to freeze them in place similar to Sub-Zero's own power. Hydro could even shoot boiling water to scald his enemies.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Mortal Kombat Legacy:</b> Hydro makes his first on screen appearance in the web series 9th episode. In this setting he has been turned into an early version Lin Kuei cyborg, unit LK 1V1, just like the more advanced units of Sektor and Cyrax. He is pitted against both Sektor and Cyrax in a training fight to see how their new programing stands up. At first Hydro seems to have the upper hand in the fight until Cyrax and Sektor start to work together and force Hydro to go offline Cyrax then uses a tri point wrist blade to slice Hydro's neck and then flip kick the cyborgs head off proving their superiority. As a cyborg Hydro does not showcase his water control powers though he does feature an extensive martial art list as well as the usual superhuman strength, speed, and cordination along with an electrical powerup ability.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930433-smokeorhydro.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930433\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5008\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.1%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930433-smokeorhydro.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930433\"><img alt=\"Cyborg Hydro\" src=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100757/1930433-smokeorhydro.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100757/1930433-smokeorhydro.png 625w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100757/1930433-smokeorhydro.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Cyborg Hydro</figcaption></figure>",

After feeding it to his unknowing neighbour, Rex Peters, he finds out. Peters turns in to a monster, with a hunger for raw meat.

Her younger sister Menagerie who also has similar shapeshifting abilities later joined the ranks of the Freedom Machine graduating from the Teen Machine.</p><p>Fable would be part of a dark period in the Machine's history when Daedalus a former member and powerful telekinetic freed several of the Machine's arch enemies. Gathering these several villain's Daedalus planed to seek vengeance on the Machine and not only destroy its reputation but kill its many past and present members. Fable fought Dr. Meggido alongside Manitou, Shadowpax, and Eden to recapture the magical villain while her other teammates tried the same. However Daedalus was not the only one amassing his forces to irradiate the Freedom Machine. The US government and Johnny Venture and his Darkside Rangers had started an operation named Red Sky.</p><p>During an assault against Daedalus and his forces on Fort Silence the US government and the Darkside Rangers released Deathboy, parachuting him over the Island. Using his deathray vision he made the entire  island and everyone on it to disappear from the planet Earth. This included Fable and the rest of the heroes who had been completely unaware that during their focus on Daedalus and his war that they had been duped by their own friends and government.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Fable has complete control of her shape and form, able to transform into any mythological creature she knows about. She has been known to transform into a dragon, a matricore, and a giant hag monster. Where she gains the extra mass in not known when she transforms into a larger creature.</p>",

(not accounting for her taste in clothing), Raven keeps a dark secret  (even from her family and best friend, Becky Miller): one that she visits every night at the local cemetery after the sun goes down.  Her boyfriend, Alexander Sterling, is a vampire.<br />     Alexander is a calm, gentle artist who only emerges at night from his mansion home on Benson Hill.  A flashback is shown, revealing that Raven discovered what Alexander was when she was checking her make-up in a pocket mirror on their first date.  Agreeing with what most vampire legends say, Alexander had no reflection, but that hardly stopped Raven from loving him.<br />     Enjoying a regular, night-time date in the woods behind the cemetery, Alexander interupts it, saying that something doesn't feel right.  They walk into the cemetery only to find four open graves, and a toy soldier laying in the grass.  He recalls that the toy belonged to his cousin, Claude, which was given to him when their extended family came from Romania to visit Alexander and Claude's grandmother at the mansion.  He also mentions that Claude had a reputation of hating Alexander, and was always jelous of him.  Mainly, because Claude is only half-vampire: a vampire who can walk in sunlight because of his mortal blood, but has fangs/immortality because of the half vampire-ness.<br />     The next couple days continue without any threat, as Raven, during the daytime, subjects herself to warding off snotty cheerleaders and listening to her best friend (and only friend) Becky talk about her new boyfriend, Matt Wells.  Tired of waiting for answers, Raven desides to hang out at the cemetery to see if Claude shows up.  To her surprise, he does, popping out of his coffin with three other friends.  Kat: the right hand girl, tough and charming (at least, until angered);  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27060/906988-ravenclaude.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-906988\"

is searching for vials that belong to his grandmother.  They find her hinding behind a tombstone, so she runs towards the exit, only to be saved by Alexander.  He reveals to her that Claude is after the vials because they contain century-old vampire blood, that could make him a full-blooded vampire, and very deadly.  He warns her to be safe, but the next day seems to change all that.<br />     Upon arriving to school late, Raven's teacher assigns her to showing the new students around the school: Claude and his gang.  He demands that she tell him where his grandmother keeps the vials, but

vampire-entangled life has her wondering if becoming an immortal (her wish) to be with Alexander forever, is really worth it.<br /><br />~~Volume 2~~<br /><br />     Due to Claude's threat on her family's life, Raven takes up the initiative to spread garlic all over the house, slightly worrying her parents and younger brother.  She goes to visit Alexander at his mansion, to discuss where the vials might be located.  He recalls a certain memory, when he and Claude where both children, where they both were playing , while their grandmother was painting, and Claude discovers a \"treasure map\" in a dresser drawer.  Their grandmother is furious and demands them both to go to their rooms.  They go looking for it afterwards, but find that it is gone and that their grandmother's room is always locked after that day.<br />     Together, they devise a plan to trick Claude with fake vials.  Raven will lead them to a false location (Claude's grandmother's old carriage house) with a false map, give them the \"vials\" and then tell him that they can only be consumed on Romanian soil, so that Claude and his gang will be gone for some time, at least.  The plan seems full-proof, and so with that, Raven leaves to go to school the next day.  <br />     As planned, Claude confronts her in the library, asking about the map.  Raven claims to not know where it is, but then Claude

contemplating the advantages (being with Alexander forever) and the down-sides (like not being able to explain her blood addiction to her family, or not being able to see her reflection in the mirror).    Raven asks Alexander about it, but he dismisses the idea, saying that he wouldn't want her to be an outsider, someone who could never fit in to both worlds, and that she's perfect just the way she is.<br />     Back at the mansion, Raven convinces Alexander that they should check out his grandmother's room, since he mentioned that he knew where the key was, but promised Grandmother not to go in.  They search the room, and find a small key, which Raven secretly keeps.  Over the next few days, Claude and his gang continue to hound Raven for the map, hoping that she'll give in since she wants to be half-vampire.  She devulges to him that she knows where it is, and will give it to him when the time is right, but he must go back to Romania afterwards with the vials.  Yet, even after this, they continue to endanger Raven's friends, including Trevor, a rich, pretty-boy soccer player who has a strange infatuation for Raven (even though she dispises him).  Seeing Raven's defiance to Claude, Kat desides it's time to take manners into her own hands...<br />     Raven, one night, goes to meet Alexander at a green-house to get the fake map from him.  However, Kat follows and shows up holding some black beauties (black roses that Alexander gave to Raven, said to be died in actual vampire bat blood).  Kat taunts Raven, saying that she and Alexander used to date in Romania and were very involved with each other.  Alexander protests, saying that it was only a one time date and that Kat's only trying to make Raven jealous.  Raven, not sure what to believe, says \"I bet he didn't sculpt for you the way he does for me.\", to which Kat replies \"He sculpted me plenty; we had some hot and heavy modeling  <figure data-align=\"left\"

leaves, and Alexander tells Raven that never even liked Kat and that he'd never keep secrets from Raven again.<br />     Raven meets Claude that night and give him the fake map.  He says that he's going after the vials tonight, and that Raven needs to \"distract\" Alexander or else Claude'll hurt Becky.  Raven agrees and goes back to Alexander who says that he has one final thing to do for the plan to make it perfect.  They wait outside the carriage house to watch Claude and his group dig.  Shortly, Claude finds a small box with vials in it, and Alexander steps out of his hiding place.  He and Claude fight, and the case is dropped in the process shattering the \"vials\" (which are fake).  Claude, enraged, that his only oppurtunity to be a full-vampire is gone, threatens that someday Alexander will be at his mercy; to which, Alexander replies that they should leave town.<br />     Back at school, Raven is blissfully writing away in her planner journal (in which she writes everything down), when Claude confronts her, mocking her that Alexander is controlling her.  Angry, Raven storms out of the classroom, forgetting her journal, which Claude quietly takes away...  That night, Raven and Alexander meet at the cemetery for a date.  In the midst of talking, they both freeze; Clade and his gang were there too...with Raven's notebook.  With everything <figure

    "description": "<h2>Character Bio</h2>Not much is known about spinner's past prior to her joining up with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\" href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\"> Initiative</a>. After completing her initiative training she was assigned to the Initiative team of Montana \"<a data-ref-id=\"4060-54215\" href=\"/freedom-force/4060-54215/\">  Freedom Force</a>\". She used her constantly changing powers to help the people of Montana along with her teammates. When the Skrull Invasion began, it was revealed that there was a Skrull impostor on every Initiative team, her teammate and friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42854\" href=\"/equinox/4005-42854/\"> Equinox</a> was revealed to be a Skrull. Upon discovering he was a Skrull, Spinner had a breakdown, not believing it was true. She soon regained control over the situation and helped the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-42982\" href=\"/skrull-kill-krew/4060-42982/\"> Skrull Kill Krew</a> defeat Equinox. She was then instructed to blow up the Initiative head quarters in each state so they couldn't use them to suck the world into the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40699\" href=\"/the-negative-zone/4020-40699/\"> Negative Zone</a>. She woke up with super speed that day and along with the speedsters <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4953\" href=\"/whiz-kid/4005-4953/\"> Whiz Kid</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57688\" href=\"/non-stop/4005-57688/\"> Non-Stop</a> she preceded to the bases with explosives. After blowing up many bases she made her way to her last job, the Hawaii base. However, her 24 hours were up and she lost her super speed just as she got to the base. Surrounded by Skrulls she took a chance and activated the explosives, hoping her new power was invulnerability. Sadly it was flight her explosives killed all of the Skrulls, the base, and sadly her.  <h3><br /></h3> <h3>Last Words</h3> <p>\"Twenty Four hours are up...Bye-Bye speed. Only one option...three second timer...(she activated the bomb). Sure hope I drew invulnerability this time around. (she floats off the ground) Flight. Crap.\"</p> <p><strong>FEAR ITSELF</strong></p> <p> Commander <a href=\"/\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\"> Steve Rogers</a> informs <a href=\"/\"> </a><a data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\"> Prodigy</a> of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the heavens and mass panic is on the horizon. Rogers asks Prodigy to gather heroes on a volunteer basis to help keep the peace and lead a new Initiative where there is no forced conscription or registration. Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of the former Initiative teams gather in Washington DC.  She can be spotted among the cadets there, but whether it's an artist mistake or not, she appears to have survived the point blank blast.<br /></p> <p> </p>Spinner's powers allow her to \"spin\" through a set of powers, getting and losing a new power every 24 hours.  <h3>List of Powers</h3>Invulnerbility <i>(off-panel)</i> <p>Super Strength: She uses this to save people from a burning building.</p> <p>Super Speed: She uses this power to defeat Equinox, who was a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43139\" href=\"/skrull/4015-43139/\"> skrull </a>impostor on her team.</p> <p>Flight: Seconds before her death this power manifested.</p>",

    "deck": "Sajin Komamura is the Captain of the 7th shinigami Division. His zanpakuto is called Tenken. He is close friends with the former ninth division captain, Kaname Tosen. He owes a great debt of gratitude towards the former captain-commander, Shigekuni Genryusai-Yamamoto. His lieutenant is Tetsuzaemon Iba.",
    "description": "<h2>Appearance</h2> <p>Sajin Komamura at first appears as a giant and quiet man, his features fully covered by armour, gauntlets and a huge full face helmet. When in combat at a later time with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42566\" href=\"/kenpachi/4005-42566/\"> Kenpachi</a> his helmet was broken off, revealing his true features: he was a humanoid fox. Despite being a fox, his stature is not stereotypical in any way, having the strength and bulk of a bear. He is a giant powerhouse of a man, not sly or agile in any way. His entire body is covered in this fur, as is evidenced when he takes off his gauntlets revealing his clawed furry hands. It is also possible that he hides his tail beneath his robes.</p> <p>After this battle, his secret was out after being revealed to all present. Previously, only <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46685\" href=\"/kaname-tosen/4005-46685/\"> Kaname Tosen</a> and their leader Yamamoto know of his appearance and they had decided to keep it a secret as Komamura wished it.</p> <h2>Personality</h2> <p>Saijin Komamura is a quiet and honorable man. He is deeply devoted to justice and shares this with his best friend Tosen. He finds it hard to form relationships with others perhaps due to his earlier treatment before he was a shinigami, which means that he is at first very shy. Deep down he is a sensitive and vulnerable figure beneath his imposing exterior and is quick to have his feelings hurt.</p> <p>Since the battle with Kenpachi and losing his best friend Tosen he has toughened up some and has gained more confidence in himself. He no longer hides his features and has a much strengthened resolve to do the right thing, even if it means properly fighting his old friend.</p> <h2>History</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14236/308538-159265-13-court-guard-squad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-308538\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14236/308538-159265-13-court-guard-squad.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-308538\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14236/308538-159265-13-court-guard-squad.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14236/308538-159265-13-court-guard-squad.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a></figure><p>Sajin Komamura at first is portrayed as a very mysterious figure. He is a huge and imposing man who speaks little and always conceals his features behind a huge full face helmet. He is shown from the very start to be the closest friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46685\" href=\"/kaname-tosen/4005-46685/\"> Kaname Tosen</a> and the two seem inseparable. This is because of a few reasons. Firstly, they both possess a very strong sense of honour and share their philosophical views, often from the same place: a hill overlooking rukongai which marks the location of a solitary grave: that of Tosens former love. Secondly is it because they are both 'pure spirits'. Tosen has very keen senses, and could sense the loneliness and purity of Komamura. Lastly, with Tosen being blind, Komamura knew that he could not see his features and was able to take off his helmet in his presence and therefore make his first friend.</p> <p>Komamura's shame in his appearance comes from the fact that he is not fully human. He was born with a foxes features, and this is a double 'shame' on him. Foxes are seen as Yokai in Japan, where the comic hails from. Yokai being evil spirits of mischief and darkness. As a humanoid fox, Komamura was often hounded out of places he tried to settle i the afterlife and could not find a single person who would trust him, till he met Tosen. When he met Tosen he found a kindred spirit, and someone who could not see what he was. He also met another spirit who was as lonely and lost as he. The two both became Shinigami together, both possessing great spiritual potential, and they earned their Captain seats quickly.</p> <p>Spending many years together as the closest of friends, Komamura was enraged when it was revealed by Tosen that he was in league with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\"> Sosuke Aizen</a>. Tosens path was the one with the least bloodshed, but Komamura could not understand how Aizens plans could lead to anything but needless bloodshed. He fought his friend, but he could not bear to bring his full force against his friend, and enraged and not thinking of fighting clearly he was quickly knocked out by his old friend. Once Tosen left, he vowed to 'beat sense into him with his own bare hands!'</p> <h2>Soul Society Arc</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18168/374441-126372-sajin-komamura.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374441\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 200px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18168/374441-126372-sajin-komamura.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-374441\"><img alt=\"Komamura in his masked form\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18168/374441-126372-sajin-komamura.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18168/374441-126372-sajin-komamura.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></a><figcaption>Komamura in his masked form</figcaption></figure><p>Komamura appears with the other captains during Ichigo's arrival to attempt to save Rukia. He is suspcious of Gin for letting Ichigo live if he is suppose to be an enemy. After Captain Aizen was slain Komamura and Tosen pay their respects over his body and Tosen talks of a friend he lost. The two find that Kenpachi,Ikkaku, and Yumichika have side with Ichigo and his friends. Tosen and Komamura are forced to face off with Kenpachi the strongest shinigami of the Gotei 13 Protection Squads. Tosen desires to fight Kenpachi alone and is defeated. Komamura quickly comes to save Tosen from further injury. In blocking Kenpachi's powerful blow Komamura's helmet splits open to reveal his animalistic features. Komamura calls forth Tenken in his bankai form. This battle of Komamura vs Kenpachi is interrupted by Aizen's betrayal. Komamura leaves at once to go deal with the traitor. Komamura is the first to be able to near Aizen and goes to attack. Aizen reveals his might by stopping Komamura's blade with two fingers. The large shinigami is struck down in a single blow. Komamura is further enraged in learning that only people that could see were capable of falling under Aizen's absolute hypnosis ability. Komamura and others learn that Tosen has also been a follower of Aizen along with Gin. Aizen uses a high level kido spell to cripple Komamura and a large hollow breaks into Soul Soceity to retrieve Aizen,Gin, and Tosen. Komamura is left wondering what kind of justice Tosen was seeking. He is comforted by Shuhei,Tosen's vice captain who was also betrayed.</p> <h2>Fake Karakura Town</h2> <p>Komamura is with the majority of the Shinigami that face Aizen his followers,the top three espada, and their fraccions. He decides to aid Ikkaku when overwhelm by Choe,an Arrancar that was slightly larger than Komamura the tallest of shinigami. Komamura's attack has no effect on Choe. The arrancar delivers a punch of his own and knocks Komamura clear across the fake town. Komamura makes his way back to save Ikkaku and Iba from a now humongously resurrected Choe. Komamura uses his bankai to block a destruction cero. He becomes in sync with Tenken to duel Choe on equal grounds. Choe grows annoyed prepares to fire another cero from the mouth. Komamura uses to Tenken to plug Choe's mouth. The cero backfires inside the whale like arrancar. Komamura then uses Tenken to bring down his massive sword to kill Choe at last. Komamura withdraws his bankai in appearance of the large hollow that had took Aizen from Soul Society.</p> <h2>Vizard vs Espada</h2> <p>The vizard arrive to kill the gillian hollowed summoned from the Garganta Corridor opened by Wonderweiss. Komamura ends up protecting the vizard,Shinji from none other than Tosen. Shuhei arrives desiring to help Komamura bring Tosen back to his senses. Tosen readies himself to attack Shinji Hirako, only for Komamura to stop him. Shinji ponders and asks Komamura if it's alright for him to help them. Komamura doesn't take no for an answer, as he thinks he is the one to bring Tosen back to his senses. Tosen and Komamura both know they had to cross swords sooner or later. Hisagi appears and offers his assistance in bringing Tosen back.  <br /> <br /></p> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148517\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 975px\" data-ratio=\"0.89435897435897\" data-width=\"975\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148517\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 975w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png\" srcset=\"http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 975w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 960w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52496/1148517-tosen_s_hollow_mask.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Tosen and Komamura discuss their situation. The Blind Captain starts talking about his full power and his willingness to unleash it. Komamura mistakes this 'power' for Tosen's Bankai, only to discover Tosen has a power much more sinister. As Tosen activates his inner hollow, Komamura and Hisagi both are shocked. Komamura questions Tosen about why he fell so quickly. After the transformation is complete, Tosen appears from within the smoke, wearing a hollow mask.  <br /> <br /></p> <p>Tosen quickly dispatches Hisagi and parries an attack from Komamura with ease. He kicks Komamura sending him crashing in the buildings below. The argument escalates as well as the fight. Tosen is briefly taken by surprise by Hisagi. Tosen states his fear of dying a pointless death among the shinigami as his main motive. Suddenly he is interrupted by the release of Komamura's Bankai.  Tosen and Komamura engage each other in battle with Tosen gaining the upper hand quite easily and quick. In the process Komamura was able to maim Tosen's arm, only for him to regenerate few seconds later. He manages to hurt Komamura quite badly, discovering that by hurting the giant that is his bankai, he can also hurt Komamura. <br /></p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146821\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 967px\" data-ratio=\"0.92864529472596\" data-width=\"967\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146821\"><img alt=\"Komamura faces off against Tosen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 967w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Komamura faces off against Tosen\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 967w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 960w, http://static7.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/52496/1146821-komamura_bankai_vs_tousen.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Komamura faces off against Tosen</figcaption></figure>The former friends converse about Tosen straying from his path of justice.

He looks around and sees Komamura, tellling him he's uglier than he thought. They battle again, but Tosens new form grants him strength and speed far exceeding  Komamura's. He completely overwhelms Komamura and blasts a giant hole in his bankai.   <br /><br />As Komamura lays wounded on the ground, Tosen approaches him. They discuss their ideas of justice and if they should end the fight already. Komamura then apologizes to Iba, Hisagi and Tosen as he could not strike his former friend down. As Tosen prepares to finish him off, they are both surprised as a blade goes through the top of Tosen's head. Hisagi has driven his sword throught Tosen's head, after that he releases his shikai, further wounding Tosen in the process.  <br /> <br />Tosen returns back to normal shortly therafter, he is wounded and too weak to fight on. Komamura tells Tosen he always knew they would fight each other and giving a heartwarming speech, Tosen lets a tear roll down his cheek. Tosen thanks him for his words and tells Hisagi that he wants to see his face, and that he can see in his Hollowfication form. But before Tosen can see Hisagi's face his body explodes, leaving Hisagi and Komamura shocked. In a fit of rage and sadness Komamura cries out Aizen's name.  <br /> <br />After Ichigo arrives to fight Aizen, Komamura steps up and gives Ichigo a piece of advice. He tells Ichigo not to fall for Aizen's mind game and that he and his fellow court guards are there to fight alongside Ichigo and protect him. He then decides to jump in on Aizen's fight with Hitsugaya, trying to aid the captain, but to no avail. Even with the use of his Bankai, Komamura was no match. Aizen sliced of a piece of his left arm, snapped his blade in two and gave him a blow to the chest which sent him hurtling down to the town below. <br /><br /><h2>Powers</h2> <p>As a captain level Shinigami, Komamura is highly skilled with the blade and has spiritual powers capable of crushing normal men or even shinigami through the raw force of his reiatsu alone, or rendering the attacks of weaker opponents ineffective. He also possesses Kidou magic and a Zanpaktou and is Bankai capable. Shinigami are additionally spirit beings, and are capable of walking on thin air (and through walls in the real world)</p> <h3>Zanpaktou</h3> <p>His Zanpaktou is named 'Tenken' or 'Heavens sword'. Its release command is 'Roar', or 'Roar, Tenken!'.<br /></p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902555\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 510px\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"510\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-902555\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-width=\"510\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png 510w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png 510w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19373/902555-vlcsnap_787026.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-width=\"510\"></noscript></a></figure><h3>Shikai</h3> <p>In its Shikai state, it creates parts of an armored giant that can follow / mimic Komamura's movements.

He had many T.V. appearances concerning interviews, and many, many other things. One day out fighting crime he came across a robber on a rooftop where he would meet his future wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52812\" href=\"/elastigirl/4005-52812/\" slug=\"elastigirl\">Elastigirl</a>. One night doing his regular saves he came across this man who didn't want to be saved trying to commit suicide by jumping a off building. Mr. Incredible was sued. This event started an onslaught of other lawsuits, and complaints about collateral damage. The government thought it best for all the \"supers\" to go into hiding.</p><p><b>The Adventure Began</b></p><p>Robert Parr married <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52812\" href=\"/elastigirl/4005-52812/\" slug=\"elastigirl\">Elastigirl</a>. She has the ability to stretch and contort her body. He was eventually late for the wedding, but he then switched his car back to the normal, non-interesting black box car. He ran in, and he then had his mask taken off by his friend. So, he went in, walked down the isle, and there was Helen waiting for him. They whispered back and fourth about how this would effect there life, and what they would have to do on the phase they were getting married, and with them getting married they decided to have a normal life. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54238\" href=\"/mr-incredible/4005-54238/\" slug=\"mr-incredible\">Robert</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52812\" href=\"/elastigirl/4005-52812/\" slug=\"elastigirl\">Helen Parr</a> ended up having three children, Violet, Dash and Jack Jack.

Jack Jack has powers that fluctuates that comes and go. He began working as a tax assistant. He went to work everyday, as he normally did, working in a small, small, small, very small cubicle for his size of man. Until one day, he had a client who was quite old, and she was crying, trying to get the money that her husband had gained through his long relationship with Insurance, the company that Robert worked for.

He is seen bench-pressing locomotives and throwing boulders at speed, even in middle age. This gives him a leaping ability of a few stories, with corresponding agility. Due his strength, also has good swimming ability, though his lung capacity does not appear to be substantially greater than a normal human's. His leg strength also gives him the ability to run significantly faster than a normal human—though neither his speed nor agility can approach that of his son, Dash.</p><p>Mr. Incredible also has a high degree of durability. He can withstand tremendous amounts of physical trauma, including multistory falls, the direct impact of a train, and breaking through brick walls. He can be cut, though, with tough, sharp metals and a suitable amount of force.</p><p>He also has very sharp senses. This power is seen when Bomb Voyage is about to blow open the vault of a sky rise building; Mr. Incredible is able to hear the faint beeping of the bomb from the other side of a bank vault.</p><p>Mr. Incredible does not exhibit superhuman intelligence, but his years of super-heroic experience allow him to rapidly formulate effective strategies to deal with opponents who cannot be bested by his strength alone. Mr. Incredible does not appear to have any superhuman weaknesses, but is as vulnerable as anyone to hubris from the veneration of his \"glory days\" and in middle age he has a <a data-ref-id=\"Back_pain\" href=\"/wiki/Back_pain/\" slug=\"wiki\">bad back</a>.</p><p>In the Operation Kronos database, Mr. Incredible was given a threat rating of 9.1, the highest rating of any of the Supers</p>",

    "deck": "Mr. Incredible's best friend Frozone has the ability to form and control ice.",
    "description": "<p>In the Golden Age of superheroes, Frozone was a longtime friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54238\" href=\"/mr-incredible/4005-54238/\" slug=\"mr-incredible\">Mr. Incredible</a>. In the beginning of the movie, shortly after interview footage, he can be seen boarding a helicopter with a hostage on board. Later, he is seen as the best man at Mr. Incredible's marriage to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52812\" href=\"/elastigirl/4005-52812/\" slug=\"elastigirl\">Elastigirl</a> (Helen Parr).</p><p>After Mr. Incredible is sued as a result of a train wreck that occurs during his rescue of it on the day of the wedding, the supers are outlawed. Many years later, as a husband and father of three, Incredible, as Bob Parr, experiences difficulty adapting to civilian life, but Lucius does not. The two of them secretly monitor police communications and intervene on behalf of endangered people for some time, hoping to relieve Bob's tension. They are both monitored by the supervillain Syndrome through his assistant, Mirage, who spies on them. The Parrs are all captured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53206\" href=\"/syndrome/4005-53206/\" slug=\"syndrome\">Syndrome</a> on his private island, Nomanisan Island; but after they free themselves, they return to Metroville, where Syndrome unleashes an immense robotic weapon called the Omnidroid on the city. Lucius, as Frozone, along with the Parrs, manage to destroy the robot.</p><h2><b>Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>The Rise of the Underminer</h3><p>Frozone arrives to help the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52727\" href=\"/incredibles/4060-52727/\" slug=\"incredibles\">Incredibles</a> fight the evil Underminer, but after the sextet is surrounded by robots, Mr. Incredible tells the rest of the family to evacuate the city along with the rest of the citizens of Metroville . After destroying the robots, Mr. Incredible and Frozone follow Underminer underground and fight more robots along the way. When they access Underminer's main computer, they learn that he plans to use a machine called the \"Magnomizer\" to make the surface world feel like his home. In order to stop the Magnomizer, they have to go through the Sludge Station. After fighting more robots and hard obstacles, they destroy a machine blocking their path and apparently do the same thing to a wall which reveals a snowy underground part. They go through it and enter a room where they encounter the Magnomizer Guardian and her robot minions. Mr. Incredible throws enough objects to make the Guardian go into overdrive and destroy the room. He and Frozone escape in time and take an elevator into the Magnomizer basement. They fight more robots and work their way up, but have to avoid falling from a trap staircase that they cross, and finally reach the top of the building, where the Magnomizer is. Mr. Incredible uses his strength to unscrew the bolts that hold the machine down while Frozone fends off the guard robots. After Incredible unscrews the last bolt, the building starts to self-destruct.</p><p>Luckily, the heroes escape with a tank-like machine which falls all the way into a deep, dark pit. There, they fight more robots, whom the Crustodian, head of the Giant Robot Factory, had alerted to the heroes' presence in the factory. Finally, the two reach the apparent main office, where Crustodian is, and eventually defeat Crustodian in battle and the factory crumbles apart. Crustodian starts to leave, and Frozone tells Mr. Incredible that there is no time to destroy it (which Incredible is obsessed with doing). They leave once Crustodian disappears and take an elevator that leads to an underwater tower.</p><p>They figure out that they are in a power pressure plant run by a robot named Dug, and that the water is breaking through the crumbling plant! The two reach Dug (after battling difficult robots), who tells them that he did not intend to have the robots attack them, and he agrees to help them save some non-human scientists who are stranded somewhere else in the plant. Along the way, the heroes protect Dug from lasers, lethal obstacles, gaps and rogue robots over which Dug has no command. After all this, Dug opens the door to another elevator to allow Mr. Incredible and Frozone to rescue the scientists, but refuses to travel any further, leaving the heroes on their own.</p><p>The heroes find the scientists and save them from being exterminated by rogue robots and lasers. After the heroes take these threats down, the scientists help them return to the surface and confront The Underminer, who shows off a giant machine. But first, the heroes must first battle more robots that Underminer has for them, and after the duo defeats the robots, Underminer returns with another machine. The heroes give damage to the machine but Underminer returns to the bigger machine while the rest of the robots fall at the hands of the heroic duo. Underminer returns to give damage to the heroes who end up giving him more damage than the other way around. When Underminer returns to the smaller machine, he has run out of reinforcements and the rest of the Incredible family returns to watch as the duo defeats him, the small machine goes haywire, takes off into the air, and crashes onto the big machine, creating a large explosion which possibly slays The Underminer, and the heroes escape the blast.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Frozone wields control over ice. He can generate ice from his fingertips, but is limited by the amount of moisture in the air and his body. He has frozen water and milk solid, and can freeze bullets in midair while encasing gun-wielding opponents in ice. As a child, he was able to freeze a bowl of fruit punch merely through force of will, without the use of his usual ice blasts. He can quickly maneuver along coasters of midair icicles (which deteriorate as he goes), which boost him in the air a good hundred or more feet. He can also take large bounds and leaps when in the air. In the movie, he skated across the air and hitchhiked onto a helicopter because of this. He can also create snow, soft enough to cushion falls and slides on rough surfaces.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>His special boots have soles which materialize into either ice skates, skis, or a disc—the equivalent of a snowboard. Combined with chutes of ice, these make for particularly speedy travel. He must also wear special goggles to protect his eyes from snow blindness, and to conceal his secret identity as Lucius Best, Bob Parr's best friend in real life.</p>",

    "description": "<p>At the beginning of the movie, the other characters believe that he doesn't have any powers. It is only at the ending of the movie when they're displayed: distraught at being forcibly taken away from his mother, an infant Jack-Jack lashes out at a surprised <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53206\" href=\"/syndrome/4005-53206/\" slug=\"syndrome\"> Syndrome</a>, who had kidnapped him, first by setting himself on fire, then becoming a lead weight, and finally a small devilish creature. Pixar also created the short film, Jack-Jack Attack that shows Jack-Jack discovering his powers while unleashing horror on his babysitter, Kari Mckeen.</p> <p>Jack-Jack normally communicates with subtle gestures and facial expressions. He usually speaks baby gibberish and can barely speak in human form—he only did so three times in the movie: first, when Lucius Best (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-54242\" href=\"/frozone/4005-54242/\" slug=\"frozone\">  Frozone</a>) rang the doorbell to the Parrs' home (he says \"Hello?\"), the second, during his confrontation with Syndrome; he threatened in his many transformations (most notably his monster form) to kill the villain, all while throwing a tantrum he cries \"Jack-Jack down!\" the infant fought and scrambled down Syndrome's leg. And third, at the end when Helen rescued Jack-Jack after being dropped by Syndrome (he coos, \"Mama!\").</p><h2>Powers</h2><br/> <p>Even though he is an infant, Jack-Jack has developed numerous super powers. How much control he has over the these powers is unknown, they may possibly be triggered by the situation as after he saw a picture of a campfire was when he first immolated himself, much to the shock of his babysitter Kari. His powers awakened during his time with the babysitter when she started playing Mozart music.</p><p>Some of his powers include<br/> </p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li> Levitation/ Flying</li><li>Shape-Shifting (Jack-Jack can change his form into fire, metal, or a monstrous demon-like, impish form. These are the three powers he uses in the film.)</li><li>Silent Teleportation (Jack-Jack instantly shifts from place to place.)</li><li>Intangibility<br/></li><li>Optic Blasts</li><li>Psychokinesis</li><li>Superhuman Strength and Agility<br/></li><li>Super-humanly Acute senses</li><li>Acidic Saliva</li><li>High Intelligence/Omnilingualism <br/></li><li>Density Control<br/></li></ul> <p>Edna Mode did not know what powers Jack-Jack would have, so she covered the basics by designing a fireproof and bulletproof, blanket sleeper like jumpsuit for Jack-Jack.</p>",

    "deck": "Eneru is the self proclaimed god of Skypiea. He can control, project and become lightning. His Devil Fruit powers make him the physical menifestation of lightning itself.",
    "description": "<h3>Bio</h3><p>Eneru has a God complex that causes him to believe that he is as important as a real deity, which causes him to act in a rather selfish and carefree way. After consuming the Devil Fruit that gave him his powers, he defeated the previous ruler of Skypiea in combat and took control of the throne. As the king of Skypiea, he lives in a grand palace where he spends his days eating and sleeping, while being waited on by dozens of women. Because he ses himself as god of his people, he kills anyone who speaks out against him. He uses his natural ability to harness mantra power to aid him in this, sensing the bioelectric impulses in another brains to tell if they are plotting against him.</p><p> </p><p>However, Eneru's reign was threatened by</p><p><a href=\"/luffy/4005-47924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47924\"> Monkey D. Luffy</a></p><p>and his band of pirates. Luffy's rubber-like body was immune to Eneru's electrical blasts, because rubber is a natural insulator against electricity. Forced to finally take a fight seriously, Eneru used his powers to superheat a gold staff, and wrapped Luffy's arm in gold. However, Luffy tried to hit Eneru with his arm, but Eneru tossed him over the side of his ship. Luffy managed to grab onto a solid cloud, using the momentum to rebound back at Eneru, hitting him even while he was in his electric form.</p><p> </p><p>After being bested in combat, Eneru decided to leave Skypiea, setting out on his ship, the Maxim, to a place called the Fairy Veath. The Fairy Veath was supposedly the home of Eneru's ancestors. He then left the kingdom of Skypiea for the Veath, which he believed to be on the moon.</p><p> </p><p>His most recent appearance sees Eneru reaching the Veath, only to find it deserted. He explores a crater, and finds a robot like alien. He shocks it out of curiosity, and it comes to life and introduces itself as a Spacy, a race of robots that were powered down long ago. The Spacy and Eneru's conversation is interrupted by a massive explosion in the distance. Horrified at the thought of someone destroying his new kingdom, Eneru runs over to the site of the blast. There, he finds a Space Pirate trying to mine the moon using explosives. The Pirate stabs Eneru through his chest with a spear, but Eneru is unharmed due to his ability. He retaliates by electrocuting the Pirate and his fellows. The Spacy that Eneru revived comes to thank him, but Eneru brushes him off and goes to explore a city on the other side of the crater. The city appeared to be decaying and empty, but Eneru has an idea and shocks the entire city. Many Spacy robots come out of their sleep and thank Eneru for restoring them. They take Eneru to their cities palace, where Eneru is amazed to find sculptures that seem to have been made by his ancestors, the Bilkans. He was then asked by the Spacy people to be their new king. Eneru happily agreed, establishing a new empire on the moon.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Eneru is a Bilkian, and he has a natural ability to sense others thoughts and tell if they are lying. This ability called mantra is enchanced by the Devil Fruit to the point, he can read the thought and hear the conversations of everyone in Skypiea effortlessly and has earned a degree of ominisciency.</p><p>Eneru can further use this ability in combat to predict the movement of his opponent. However, he is not able to predict random movements as shown when luffy bounced his fist off the wall above Eneru. As Luffy was not sure where his punch would land, neither was Eneru able to predict and dodge the punch.</p><p> </p><p>Eneru has eaten a Devil Fruit, the Rumble-Rumble Fruit (Goro Goro no Mi). It gives him the ability to control and project lightning at will. As a logia type Devil Fruit user, Enel has the ability to become intengible, in the form of electricity. In his electric form, normal attacks pass right through him. Also, even after being caught off guard and killed by an attacker, he restarts his heart with an electrical impulse, coming back to life. He does not need air to survive, and can live outside of the atmosphere, as shown when he functions quite well on the moon. He can power devices with his body, as shown when he restarts the Spacys and powers his ship.</p><p>Enel can project massive amounts of electricity without effort. This feat is witnessed countless times during the fight with Luffy where he discharges up to 200 million walts of electricity. He can also produce temperatures up to 6000 degrees as a byproduct of lightning. Eneru being physical lightning, can use this ability to shape his weapon to one of choice and heat it accordingly. He himself has shown no effect of this heat as he used the weapon in combat against Luffy without it harming him while Luffys skin burned simply from touching it.</p><p> </p><p>Eneru has shown himself to be in very good physical condition, as he is able to shrug off painful blows that would cripple a normal person. He is very agile, and often does one handed backflips to show off. He is a skilled combatant, and can even face the likes of Luffy to a near standstill.</p><p>He has a great intelligence, and shows expertise in electrical physics, understanding conductivity and insulators, utilizing this knowledge to his advantage. He knows how to repair his ship when it was destroyed, and seems to have studied his ancestors extensively, talking about their art and literature with the Spacys.</p><p> </p><h3>Trivia</h3><p> </p><p>His favorite food are apples, as shown in his palace in Skypiea where he eats many of them a day. In One Piece Grand Battle Rush!, his taunt is to eat an apple.</p><p> </p><p>Writers have comfirmed that if he was to take his hat off, his hair would be curly.</p><p> </p><p>His looks match his god complex; his long earlobes rest over his chest much like Buddha, and his favorite pose is reclining on his side, much like Buddha statues.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Before the White Event happened, Emmet Proudhawk worked for the Foundation. His job was to find people who had high ESP scores and make a list of these people. After the White Event he gained telepathic abilities and started to have precognitive dreams. Using his dreams he only found Tucker, Crawley, Jessup, Ling, and Inyushin. He convinced them to run to San Fransisco to the Sanctuary. While there he tries to convince everyone to stay. Wayne Tucker declines and tells him he's leaving tomorrow. Staci leaves and calls the KGB to take her away. Emmet pushed the kids into following him to find her, while there the KGB shows up with Mindwolf. Emmet goes on a telepathic battle with Mindwolf but Mindwolf was too powerful and killed him.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Emmet Proudhawk was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-46469\" href=\"/stephen-perry/4040-46469/\" slug=\"stephen-perry\">Stephen Perry</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-3267\" href=\"/mark-texeira/4040-3267/\" slug=\"mark-texeira\">Mark Texeira</a> in 1986 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-11495\" href=\"/psi-force/4050-11495/\" slug=\"psi-force\">Psi-Force</a> # 1. </p>",

Sylvanas made her last stand against the former prince himself but was ultimately defeated and raised to undeath to serve as one of his lieutenants.</p><h3>Rebellion and forming the Forsaken</h3><p>Not long after, the Lich King's control over the Scourge weakened, allowing Sylvanas and many undead to break free of his control. Sylvanas became the leader of the fledgling nation of undead fighters dubbed the Forsaken. Under her leadership, the Forsaken took over parts of Tirisfal Glades as well as the Plaguelands but remained in constant fighting with Arthas and the Scourge.</p><p>Eventually, Arthas was recalled to the Frozen Throne by the Lich King and Sylvanas rallied the Forsaken to secure control over Lordaeron.

Sylvanas and many other leaders of the Horde took the fight to Northrend and confront the Scourge once and for all.</p><p>After a long second conflict with the Scourge, the combined military might of the Alliance, the Horde, and the Argent Crusade finally struck the Frozen Throne and slew Arthas. Sylvanas, not satisfied without seeing Arthas' corpse, traveled to the ruins of Icecrown alone.

Because of her young age she is always poking her nose in things, trying to get an idea of whats going on all the time and hates to be excluded from anything that her parents or Chibiusa are involved in and at most times even has valuble information the scouts because of her knowlege of the future. </p><p>In the manga, she first makes her appearance when the Sailor Scouts make their way to the 30th century, and there is also revealed to be the child of Luna and Artemis. Also in the manga she does return to the 20th century with them to learn from her parents and scouts.</p><p>In the anime she doesn't appear till later in the series, and unlike the manga she randomly makes her first appearance by jumping out of the bushes and calling Artemis 'daddy' while curling up to him. This left not only a shocked and confused Artemis but a very upset Luna who assumed he had an affair with another cat. It wasn't until later that Diana came from the future and that both cats were infact her parents. </p><p>While Luna is black and Artemis is white, Diana is grey with bright red, almost pink, eyes. </p><p>First Appearances: </p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Manga: Act 18</li> <li>Anime: Episode 133</li> </ul>",

    "deck": "Caleb developed a theory about Namor's blood causing Namor's frequent rages and emotion imbalances. He worked on a blood-recirculator that would help Namor.",
    "description": "<br/><br/>Caleb Alexander grew up at the end of World War II in Harlem, New York.  His favorite pass-time was reading comic books about the war-time heroes.  Caleb's dad gave him a bike that he'd saved for for a long time.  One day when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" slug=\"captain-america\">Captain America</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\" href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\" slug=\"jim-hammond\">Jim Hammond</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\" href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" slug=\"namor\">Namor</a> were scheduled to appear in New York, Caleb rode his bike to go and see them.  He followed Namor, who was flying in the air, on his bike and ended up falling over the pier into the ocean.  Getting tangled in his bike, Caleb would have drown if not for Namor saving him.  Caleb became fascinated with marine biology and traded his bike in for his first marine biology text, making his parents proud. <br/><br/>Over the following years, Caleb developed a theory about Namor's blood causing Namor's frequent rages and emotion imbalances.  He worked on a blood-recirculater that would help Namor.<br/><br/>Caleb's wife died when their daughter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28445\" href=\"/carrie-alexander/4005-28445/\" slug=\"carrie-alexander\">Carrie</a>, was three years old, and he never remarried. Caleb then suffered from two heart attacks, and had to give up deep-sea diving. Due to his failing health, Carrie came to work with her dad.<br/><br/>While sailing on his boat  with Carrie, Caleb detected a fast-moving radar blip moving towards them and was shocked to see what looked like Namor shoot out of the water and followed him to a nearby island to investigate.  They found Namor terrorizing the village of Chief Ve'ehalo and having hallucinations of his dead wives.  Caleb realized that his blood-recycling may help Namor, and they convinced Namor to come back to their ship with them.  After a treatment, Namor's head was clear and Caleb showed Namor the device.  Grateful, Namor brought the Alexanders a large chest of jewels and asked them to help him run a business. The Alexanders used Namor's money to buy-out Parallel Conglomerate, and renamed it <span>Oracle, Incorporated</span>. <br/><br/>Caleb showed interest in Carrie's struggle over Namor's romantic feelings for her, but Carrie asked Caleb to let her sort it out on her own.    When the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15386\" href=\"/griffin/4005-15386/\" slug=\"griffin\">Griffin</a> burst through Oracle's window and snatched Carrie, Caleb prepared to defend her, but was knocked aside and then suffered a heart attack.  Caleb crawled to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\" href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" slug=\"namorita\">Namorita</a> and she was able to get him medical attention. <br/><br/>Unconscious in the hospital, Caleb was visited by Carrie after she was rescued by Namor.  With Carrie at his side, Caleb recovered.  Namor decided to go public as a result of his battle.<br/><br/>Businessman J.Q. Stamp kidnapped Caleb and Carrie and threatened their lives in order to force Namor into signing Oracle, Inc. over to him. Namor did so, but then had Namorita dress up as Tigress Shark to trick Stamp into thinking he would have to face all of Namor's enemies now that he owned Oracle. Stamp gave Oracle back to Namor to save himself. When he learned that he had been tricked, he told to his men to kill Caleb and Carrie, but Namor had already set them free.<br/><br/>Caleb and Carrie went on an ocean cruise to give Caleb a chance to recuperate from his heart attack.  After a few weeks, Caleb grew antsy to get home to help Namor with the legal challenges he was having.  Caleb noticed the boat changing course, then Carrie noticed that Namorita was coming to join them, swimming with a group of dolphins.  Captain O'Malley and the Skipper asked Namorita to investigate.  Soon, pollution called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28665\" href=\"/sluj/4005-28665/\" slug=\"sluj\">Sluj</a> swarmed over the boat and absorbed all the passengers. Carrie and Caleb were put inside life support bubbles inside of Sluj, to be used for a food source later.<br/><br/>After being freed from Sluj,  Carrie admitted to Caleb and Namorita that she had realized that she really did love Namor, and tried to convince them that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28049\" href=\"/phoebe-marrs/4005-28049/\" slug=\"phoebe-marrs\">Phoebe Marrs</a> had ulterior motives for Namor. Carrie finally convinced Namorita to go check on Namor.<br/><br/>Caleb Alexander was called on to testify at Namor's trial, where Namor was being charged for all his battles against the surface world.  After Caleb was questioned by Mr. Klein, Namor's lawyer, about Namor's oxygen imbalance, the jury found Namor guilty but insane.  Namor was given one hundred years of probation.<br/><br/>While Namor and Carrie were off in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\" href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" slug=\"savage-land\">Savage Land</a>, Namor asked <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28164\" href=\"/desmond-marrs/4005-28164/\" slug=\"desmond-marrs\">Desmond Marrs</a> to keep an eye on Oracle.  Caleb arrived at Oracle and heard from Miss O'Connor that Desmond was selling off large shares of Oracle's holdings.  He rushed in to confront Desmond, who said he had no intention of stopping.  Caleb was going to report Desmond, but Desmond smashed a vase over Caleb's head and then beat the unconscious old man repeatedly.<br/><br/>After two hours, Miss O'Connor asked Spitfire to investigate, and they found Caleb unconscious. After six months, Caleb was still on life support and didn't seem to be recovering, and soon after, passed away.<br/>",

    "description": "<p>Neku Sakuraba is a anti-social fifteen year old boy who lives in the Shibuya district of Japan. He is the main protagonist of The World Ends With You.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>The First Week</h2><p>Neku, with no recollection as to how or why he got there, wakes up in the middle of a intersection in Shibuya, Japan. He has no memory of anything but his name, and soon discovers that no on can see, hear, or touch him. He finds a black pin with a skull ensignia in his pocket, which allows him to read the minds of the people around him, which shakes him up quite a bit. He doesn't have much time to think about it, though, because within moments he is attacked by odd monster which destroy people as they manifest. He flees, but just as he is about to be killed by the creatures, a girl his age appears and yells \"Make a pact with me!\" to him. He reluctantly accepts, and the two are then able to harness supernatural powers and defeat the monsters, which are revealed to be called \"Noise\". The girl shows her astonishment that Neku is so proficient with these attacks-which are activated by using a variety of Pins. She can only use one, while Neku can apparently use them all. The girl doesn't tell him much other than her name-which is Shiki Misaki-as it appears she expects him to know everything important already. In a moment highlighting his detatchment from other people, Neku leaves her alone, not caring about what she does. She catches up, and as the two begin to question eachother, his cell phone rings. He finds a text message inside, which reads \"Reach 104. You have 60 minutes. Fail, and face erasure-The Reapers\". He assumes it to be junk mail, and tries to delete, discovering that he can't. A timer then painfull materializes on his hand, which has a sixty minute countdown. 104 is a building only about a block away-the two reach there, Neku only doing so hoping to find some answers. As they reach the square where the building is located, the timer disappears, and the \"Mission\" is completed.</p><p>The two wake up back in the intersection whre Neku first awoke, which is called \"Scramble Crossing\"-it is the next day, and they somehow jumped into the future a day. Another mail appears, this time telling the two to \"Cleanse the statue of it's curse\". Shiki, knowledgable about the comings and goings of Shibuya, decides that the \"Statue\" must be the statue of the dog, Hachiko. The two walk to the statue, and Neku uses his Pin to find that Noise is possessing it. They destroy the Noise, and the timer disappears from their hand, again. Another figure appears, one that introduces herself as a Reaper-while she never tells Neku her name, it is Uzuki Yashiro. All Reapers look like humans, but have odd black wings-and sends more Noise after the pair. After destroying the monsters, the female Reaper tries to trick Neku into killing Shiki, promising that she will free Neku from the game if he does so. Either that, or she will erase Neku herself. He grudgingly enters the game without understanding it fully, and is forced to kill Shiki. Before he can do so, a man appears, and stops him, ordering the Reaper to stop her trick. The man calls himself \"Mr. H\", and he tells Neku that even if he did kill Shiki, the Reaper would've erased him anyways, as a Player cannot fight without a pact with another.</p><p>Here is where Neku discovers much of \"The Game\". The area that The Game takes place in is called the Shubuya UG-Underground-another plane of the real Shibuya where everything that occurs is possible. All of the Players in the game have died in the RG-Real Ground-which is the \"living world\". Upon their deaths in Shibuya, they are given a choice, to either fade away or enter the game at the price of their most prized possession, which is their entry fee. If the Player survives for seven days by completing all of the missions, then they are resurrected into the RG, and given another chance at life. If they fail one mission or are defeated in the UG, then they are erased from existence. Mr. H himself is like a guardian for the Players, and makes sure that the Reapers-who are the gamerunners-do not break the \"Rules\" or The Game. The Game is run by The Composer, who is a extremely powerful being who created the UG, and has several subordinates, who are Reapers. The Game has been going on for several years, a new one initiated every week. Each Game has a Game Master who brings their own style and missions to the Game. There are also more than just one Game area-the Shibuya UG is only one of them.</p><p>After explaining this to Neku, he sends them off, wishing them the best of luck and offering to tell them anything that they need should they come for it.</p><p>For the next several days, Neku and Shiki complete various tasks and meet new Reapers. Neku learns that Shiki is a skilled fashion designer, and that everything she wears is of her own making. Even her stuffed animal-which she attacks Noise with telekinetically-she created. They meet another pair of Players, Beat and Rhyme, Beat being a act-first, think later kind of teenager, and Rhyme being a small, kind, and intelligent girl. Neku angers Beat with his anti-social attitude upon their first meeting. After a few days, the four Players work together and complete a mission, and it is revealed that if only one pair of Players complete the days mission, then they all move on. However, on one of the days, a powerful Noise comes out of no where and attacks Beat on surprise-Rhyme pushes him out of the way and takes the attack, and is erased. Neku and Shiki destroy the Noise, but Beat runs off, alone against the missions.</p><p>Neku and Shiki gradually begin to know eachother more, and Neku learns that Shiki's entry fee was her own appearance-the body that she inhabits is that of one of her RG friends, Eri. Shiki was jealous of everything that Eri had-looks, popularity, talent-and wished to be her. At first, when she discovered that she looked like Eri in the UG, she was excited-but she soon began to hate herself for being so envious, and really valued her own individuality the most. Neku convinces her that she does not need anyone else's abilities to succeed-that if she tries, she can reach for anything and grasp it. This comforts Shiki, and the two promise to meet eachother in the RG in front of Hachiko, after they complete the Game.</p><p>Upon the seventh day, the two are given their final mission-defeat this Game's Game Master. After travelling to the destination and fighting a long, hard battle, they defeat the powerful Reaper, and are transported into a oddly decorated white room. They meet the Conductor-the Composer's right hand man. He  congratulates the two on their success, but tells them that only one can move forward-that was one of the rules all along. The Player with the highest score of the Game moves on, and the ones left behind have a few choices-either become a Reaper, play the Game again in the hopes of completing it, or be erased. The Conductor tells them that Shiki was the one with the higher score, and so, she is transported back into the RG, given the second chance that she was earlier afraid of. Beat then arrives, somehow surviving the remaining days with the loss of his partner, and asks the Conductor if he can enter the next Game as a Reaper. The Conductor allows him to do so, and grants him the power of a Reaper.</p><p>Neku chooses to play the Game again, determined to win and fulfill his promise to Shiki. The Conductor returns Neku's first entry fee-his memory. Neku only gets fragments, though, as it appears he simply cannot remember what happened to him when he died. Then, in order for Neku to join the Game a second time, the Conductor takes Neku's now most valued thing in his life-Shiki. If Neku does not complete the game, then he and Shiki will both be erased. He then sends Neku back to the Scramble, and starts the second Game.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>The Second Week</h2><p>Neku starts the next Game, and is immediately attacked by Noise, much like his first week. However, without even giving his consent, he makes a Pact with a boy his age named Joshua, and the two erase the Noise. Joshua tells Neku virtually nothing of himself, and the mission arrives. \"34 + 70=X. T=60 minutes. Fail, and face erasure-The Reapers\". The format changed, which means that a new Game Master has been put into play. Joshua quickly deduces that the message means to go to the 104 within 60 minutes (30 + 74=104), which is the same mission as last's week's first day.</p><p>For the next week, the two go fulfilling the missions, are attacked by a powerful Beat numerous times-but never erased or never defeating him-and traverse Shibuya looked for \"The River\". Neku discovers that he can scan Joshua, which is not normal, as Players cannot scan other Players or Reapers-they can only scan those in the RG. After delving into his mind, Neku finds bits of memory that make it seem like Joshua was the one who killed him in real life. Neku does not confront him about this, deciding that he does not have enough evidence. After much pressing, Neku discovers that Joshua is looking for The River, as it leads to the Composer-and he wants to defeat the Composer and take his place as the master of the UG. The two actually do find the entrance to the River, but it is blocked by a huge wall, and they cannot enter. Throughout the week, the meet the Game Master several times-he is a man named Sho, who has a obsession with numbers and mathematics. He is also painting mysterious symbols on walls, which summon Taboo Noise which attack anything, whether Reaper or Player, which is considered treason to the Reaper organization. Sho, however, has gone into hiding, and cannot be found. After encountering a large number of the superpowered Taboo Noise, it is revealed that Joshua has extra-powerful abilities, as he is not really dead-he can see the entire UG because, in the RG, he can see the dead, and has been watching The Game for many years. Since he is alive and playing the Game, he is much more powerful than most Players. He also tells Neku that Mr. H is a anonymous mega-millionaire who goes by the name of CAT-the art, fashion, and music that CAT produced is all of Neku's favourites, and so he adored the company and it's ideals of staying true to yourself. Mr. H even told Neku at his cafe that he should broaden his horizons, saying that \"The world ends with you\", meaning that how far you can have a perspective of something means that that is how far you can advance. Neku is ecstatic to know that he met CAT.</p><p>At the seventh day, they receive their final mail-defeat the Game Master at Pork City (the name of a building where several Reapers hide out). They traverse through the Taboo Noise-infested Shibuya as the once in-control Reapers are under attack from the Noise, and rise through the floors of Pork City, encountering Sho, who apparently did not send the mission mail. Neku scans him, and discovers that in the memory of Joshua shooting him, Joshua was really shooting past him-and hitting Sho, who then shot Neku. Neku and Joshua battle with Sho, and defeat him in battle. Before he fades away, Sho self-destructs, in a attempt to kill the two Players. Joshua pushes Neku away, and absorbs most of the attack himself, and is erased.</p><p>Neku once again finds himself in the white room with the Conductor. He is the only Player who survived this week, and is expecting to be reunited with Shiki back in the RG. However, since he was a partner with a Player who was in clear violation of the Game's rules, the entire week did not count-and the Conductor sends Neku back to start another week and play one more Game, with the same entry fee as the last, but an added penalty-the new entrance fee, along with Shiki, is all of the Players. This means that Neku is alone in the game, and cannot battle. Also, there can be no more Games for Neku after the third.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>The Last Week</h2><p>Neku wakes up in the Scramble for the last time. He is attacked, again by Noise and Reapers-however, Beat comes, and forms a Pact with him, deciding that joining the Reapers in the first place was a mistake. With his is a small, tame Noise. However, after defeating the Noise and Reapers, the new Game Master named Mitsuki appears, and charges Beat with a price for his betrayal. Not only does she steal his pet Noise and erase it-somehow also changing it into a Pin-but she gives Beat five days in the UG before he is erased, as his Reaper score-established by erasing Players, which Beat never did-was so low that it only gave him that long. She thens says that there is only one mission for this week-to find and erase her. She then leaves with the Pin, which Beat is furious about.</p><p>For the next days, Beat and Neku go looking for the Game Master, and it is eventually revealed that the Noise that Beat had with him was Rhyme. His plan all along was to find the Composer and defeat him, which would install Beat as the new one, and give him the power to resurrect Rhyme. Throughout all of this, Neku and Beat notice that the popularity of a Pin that looks startingly like the Player Pin is rising in the RG. The Pin is produced by CAT, and also is a Pin that the Reapers use to power themselves up-which they use often, as the UG has been put on Emergency Alert, allowing the Reapers to attack the Players at will. This would essentially mean that Mr. H is either the Composer or a high-ranking Reaper-something that Neku refuses to believe.</p><p>After a few days of searching, Neku and Beat again encounter Uzuki Yashiro and her partner, Kariya-who is a Reaper that has been asked to be promoted several times, only to turn it down time and time again, instead preferring the excitement of the field. Because of this, he is arguably the most powerful field Reaper active. Kariya has Beat's Pin, and tells Beat that if the two can defeat him, he will return it. The day ends and the two find them trapped underneath an overpass by several barriers. Here, Neku learns that Beat and Rhyme were siblings. They died in that very spot, as Beat had been arguing with his parents and ran off, and Rhyme followed him. A car sped towards them as they crossed the road, and Beat tried to push her out of the way and failed, and they both died. Beat is ashamed of the fact that Rhyme managed to save him from being erased by the Noise, but him, someone much stronger and faster, could not save her. Upon entry to the UG, Rhyme did not remember anything about Beat, which was apparently her entry fee. Neku manages to convince Beat that it was not his fault for doing what he did, and that he can still rectify things by defeating the composer. The two then manage to solve a puzzle box in order to find the Keypin inside, and meet with Kariya. The two find him at the meeting place, and battle him along with Uzuki, and are victorious. However, it is revealed that the Pin given to Kariya was a fake replica of the real one-he was unaware of this, and apologizes to Beat. As some consolation, he gives beat a Keypin, which will dispell a wall-barrier-that leads to one of the last places that the two haven't looked for the Game Master in. They go there-which is also Udagawa, the place where Neku was shot by Sho-and find the strange symbols that summon Taboo Noise. They should've been destroyed some time ago, but the symbol appears to be new. With a gadget installed in his phone by Mr. H that allows him to take pictures of what occured in the past, Neku discovers that Mr. H had been painting it. He still clings on to the hope that Mr. H is not the Game Master, however. They also discover that almost everyone in all of Shibuya-including Reapers-are seemingly possessed by the Red Pins that were growing in popularity. They all speak and think the same thing, and attack Beat and Neku upon sight.</p><p>They then discover that Sho has revived himself by possessing a body with the power of Taboo Noise-he is now incredibly powerful, and actively searching for the Composer. He is so strong that he can blast straight through walls themselves. There is now only one place that Neku and Beat have not investigated-Cat street, where Mr. H's cafe is. The stop by, but do not find the Game Master, and proceed to enter Mr. H's cafe, WildKATS. They find the place in shambles, as it had been searched. Neku takes out his phone to try and discover what happened, telling Beat what it is capable of. Excited, Beat tries it out, not aware of the fact that it can only snap three photos a day. Luckily, they find that in one of the photos, it shows Mr. H hiding something behind a painting. It is a Keypin that can open the door to the Shibuya River, and the two head off, hoping to find and defeat the Composer before Sho can. They find that the wall to the River is in ruins-and enter, rushing to find the Composer before Sho can. They find that there is one last barrier, and Beat is already starting to fade. Sho is already at the blocked path, and reveals to Beat and Neku that the Game Master was hiding out in Beat's shadow all along-the one place where he couldn't find her. She then opens up the barrier, allowing Sho to go ahead and confront the Conductor. She is really only using him, knowing that he cannot stand up against the Composer or the Conductor, and hopes to defeat the Conductor after he is weakened with his battle with Sho. She then battles with Neku and Beat. She is ultimately defeated after having stolen all of Neku's Pins, she drops the one that had Rhyme's Noise within it, and Neku uses the Pin to defeat her.</p><p>The two move ahead, now with the final barrier open. They hear footsteps behind, and discover that Shiki is now in the UG again. Neku explains everything that happened to her, and she is embarrassed to realize that she is the most prized thing in Neku's life.</p><p>The three move ahead, and enter the white room that they had found themselves in after they had completed the first week. Inside is the Conductor, who possesses's Shiki. Beat and Beku fight him while battling with the possessed Shiki, and erase the Composer. However, she still attacks them, not in her right self. Neku realizes that she is under the control of the Red Pin. Before he can act, she launches another attack at him. Beat takes the hit, and is knocked unconscious. Neku then destroys the Red Pin, and frees Shiki of it's influence. She blacks out, and Neku is now alone to face the Composer in battle.</p><p>He moves forward, finding himself at the end of the Shibuya area. The Conductor then appears, laughing at Neku for having assumed that he had defeated him. He then reveals that the Red Pins were of his making. He had been apalled at how Shibuya was quickly becoming a place of hate and fear. By using the Red Pins to make everyone think the same thing, he believed that he was saving it from eventual self-destruction. Not only that, but by using the equipment of the room they were in, he would pulse out the thoughts to the other Game areas, and take control of them all. It was how he possessed the Reapers, but the Pins cannot possess someone with a Player Pin. He destroys Neku's Player Pin, promising to free him from the pain of individuality. Upon trying to take control of him, though, he finds he cannot-for Neku has two Player Pins. Beat and Shiki then catch up, and the trio battle the Conductor again, and defeat him.</p><p>Suddenly, Joshua appears, to the surprise of the Conductor. However, Shiki, Joshua, and Beat are all held captive by the Conductor, who transforms into a huge monster. Neku battles him, forging a four-way pact with Beat, Shiki, and Joshua, and then finishes him off with a massive energy attack.</p><p>The Conductor reverts back to his normal form, and talks to Joshua. It is fully revealed that Joshua had been the Composer all along. A month ago, he planned to erase Shibuya off the map through the usage of his powers because of how much negativity and hate had been generating, not willing to have it move on and infect the rest of the Game areas, but was stopped at the willing of the Conductor, who promised that he could \"save\" Shibuya. The Composer then created a game with the Conductor-he would be given one month, and if he could change Shibuya enough, then he would not erase it. However, The Composer would be doing what he could-in moderation, as he could do whatever he wanted-to ensure that the Conductor fails. Joshua tells the Conductor that it was one of his most enjoyable games, and the Conductor says that he enjoyed it, and then fades away.</p><p>Joshua then returns the rest of Neku's memory, and finally, Neku is shown that Joshua did kill him, as Neku was the person that Joshua had chosen to be his representative in his Game. Sho had been trying to find and kill The Composer for some time, as he wanted his power-after Joshua shot Sho and wounded him in front of Neku in the RG, he then shot and killed Neku, and gave him the extra Player Pin which allowed him to not be possessed by The Conductor.</p><p>Neku had been playing on his team all along.</p><p>Now, Joshua lets Neku in for one more game. There are two guns-whoever shoots the other will get to be the Composer, and decide on Shibuya's fate. Joshua transports Shiki and Beat away, and Neku and The Composer draw. Neku, though, finds that he cannot kill Joshua, and is shot. Just as he blacks out, he sees Mr. H standing behind Joshua. He hadn't been the Composer, but rather the producer-he made the Pins.</p><p>Neku then wakes up at the Scramble again, confused and saddened. For one week, he explores, and then meets up with Beat and a restored Rhyme in front of Hachiko. Shiki then appears in her real body, and the four go off and enjoy their lives. Joshua did not erase Shibuya-the fact that a unsociable boy who hated life could meet friends and fight for them secured his mind that there was still good there, and he allowed it to continue to exist, and transported the four players back into the RG. Neku then changes the words that Mr. H told him those weeks ago-\"The world begins with you\".</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Manga</h2><p>The first chapters of The World Ends With You manga can be read here, at Square Enix's members site:</p><p>http://member.square-enix.com/na/features/wewy/02/</p><p>The manga has only been published in Japan by Square Enix's own manga magazine.</p>",

A stranger seeking shelter sensed her needs and gave her the gift of the Box. To some she is a vision of pain, a Gothic atrocity, to others she is the bringer of such sweet sensations.</p><p>They say that her name is unmentionable.</p><p>The horrid name, like her actions, is so vile it must forever remain unspoken. Those unfortunate enough to have discovered her true name have never returned to utter it. Therefore, she is referred to as merely the <i>Female </i><i>Cenobite</i>.</p><p>She is the fierce virgin demon in the <i>Order of the Gash</i>, with a heart of tar so black that it is incapable of love and sympathy. Incredibly violent, she is all but uncontrollable, even by <a href=\"/pinhead/4005-41465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41465\"> Pinhead</a>. Left-handed, impatient and relentlessly cruel, she wields sharp razors of both steel and tongue. To know her is to suffer the full tortures of Hell for eternity.</p><p>She remains one of the most elusive of the Cenobites, a far cry from her sister, <a href=\"/abigor/4005-82941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82941\">Abigor</a>, the extrovert, preferring to wield her power with a subtle grace that few in hell could manage. . .

Several wires peel back the skin around her neck, causing her to have a whispery voice. In the sequel four of the wires holding her throat open have been removed, leaving just one frame. When she is killed at the end of the second <i>Hellraiser </i>film, she reverts back to her original human form, revealing that she had once been a pretty brunette woman.</p><p> </p><p><b>Media Appearances With Female Cenobite As Villain</b></p><ul><li>-Hellraiser (1987)</li></ul><ul><li>-Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 (1988)</li></ul>",
