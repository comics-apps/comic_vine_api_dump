She has the ability to drain the psychic energy from others and use it as psionic force. When battling Booster she used this ability to drain the life force of everyone in the 1000 base killing everyone. She then used the power to attack Booster. She failed in this attack when the Thorn came to Booster's aide. Her mask was taken off in the battle revealing only a horrific skull with no face appearing. This horrified Mindancer and stunned the heroes giving her the time to escape. Mindancer has not been seen since. She was seen an a recent prison escapee during The Infinite Crisis and has crossed paths with Kyle Rayner.",

    "description": "<h2><u>Background and Overview</u></h2><p>Hinamori is the ex-vice captain of the 5th division under the traitor captain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42859\" href=\"/sosuke-aizen/4005-42859/\">Aizen Sosuke</a>. She is the childhood friend of Captain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46357\" href=\"/toshiro-hitsugaya/4005-46357/\">Toshiro Hitsugaya</a> whom she still thinks of as a little brother. She is a trusting and naive person who forms relationships with others very easily, which is her biggest weakness. She tends to grow very obsessive over people that she forms bonds with and is very hard to change, which is evidenced by how she cannot stop calling Hitsuhaya by his pet-name, even though he is a ranking Captain in a military-esque organization and has to maintain authority over his men. She fell deeply in love with Aizen due to his charisma and deceptive ways and was manipulated by him into nearly killing her childhood friend Toshiro Hitsugaya.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/1079714-148527_bleach602_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079714\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 600px\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/1079714-148527_bleach602_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079714\"><img alt=\"Momo\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/1079714-148527_bleach602_super.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/1079714-148527_bleach602_super.jpg 600w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46321/1079714-148527_bleach602_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\"></a><figcaption>Momo</figcaption></figure><p>She appears as a fairly normal girl, and does not stand out in many ways. She seems to represent the average person in the comic, and has the most failings.</p><h2><u>More recently</u></h2><p>Despite Captain Aizens betrayal of her, she still finds herself swayed by him into trying to follow him due to her obsessive compulsive tendencies. This makes her a danger to those around her, as she had already shown herself capable and willing to betray her companions for his sake. When she was given a communication link to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46357\" href=\"/toshiro-hitsugaya/4005-46357/\">Toshiro Hitsugaya</a> during a mission he was leading she openly appealed to him to try and save captain Aizen, despite him being the mastermind behind the betrayal of soul society, having nearly killed her and everyone she loves.</p><p>Hinamori doesn't appear in the series again until much later. She makes a brief appearance in the Arrancar Arc where she speaks to Toshiro via a monitor. She tells him that Aizen is not bad and that Gin is manipulating him; she refuses to accept her Captains treachery. This shows how mentally unstable she has become. One can even see how ill she is at this point via her appearance. Her speech is interrupted as she is knocked unconscious by the Captain Commander.</p><p>Later during Fake Kakura Town Arc, she appears out of nowhere and saves Matsumoto's life from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55108\" href=\"/halibel/4005-55108/\">Harribel's</a> three Fraccion. She announces that she now acknowledges Aizen as a enemy and threat to Soul Society, showing that she is slowly getting better. She then reveals that she had hidden her presence using her Kidō and had created a Kidō net around the three Fraccion and Matsumoto. She then uses her Zanpakuto, releasing her Shikai. She uses her blade to cause the Kidō net to explode, \"destroying\" the three Fraccoin.</p><h2><u>Powers</u></h2><p>Hinamori possesses the standard array of Shinigami powers, though at an advanced level as she is a vice captain. These include Kido Magic (Demon Magic), Air walking, short range teleport (Shunpo) and sword skills using her <a data-ref-id=\"4055-42856\" href=\"/zanpakuto/4055-42856/\">zanpaktou</a> (Spirit slaying sword). In practice, she is a Kido type who prefers long range magic attacks.</p><h2><u>Zanpaktou</u></h2><p>Her sword is named Tobiume (flying plum tree). It is a Kidou type blade that's Shikai release activation phrase is 'snap'. When it is activated the blade straightens and produces several jutted-like prongs along its blade. In this state it is able to fire energy attacks, or release its full payload in a single devastating energy ball. She has proven herself quite skilled with this blade, but its powers are limited by her potential.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Thomas A. Anderson, \"Neo,\" was born on March 11, 1962 in Lower Downtown, Capital City, USA. His is the only child of John Anderson and Michelle McGahey. For education he attended Central West Junior High and Owen Patterson High shining in particular at math, science and any computer courses, as well as demonstrating a propensity for both English and History.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Neo was created by the Wachowski Brothers (<a href=\"/andy-wachowski/4040-64773/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-64773\">Andy Wachowski</a> and <a href=\"/lana-wachowski/4040-61219/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61219\">Lana Wachowski</a>), for use in <i>The Matrix Trilogy (<a href=\"/the-matrix/4025-120/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-120\">The Matrix</a>, <a href=\"/the-matrix-reloaded/4025-123/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-123\">The Matrix Reloaded</a>, <a href=\"/the-matrix-revolutions/4025-124/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-124\">The Matrix Revolutions</a>)</i>, <i>The Animatrix</i>, The Animatrix short film <i>Kid’s Story</i>, video-games, as well as <i><a href=\"/the-matrix-comics/4050-27029/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-27029\">The Matrix Comics</a></i>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>At the beginning of <a href=\"/the-matrix/4025-120/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-120\">The Matrix</a> Thomas Anderson is a programmer for the company Meta Cortex and is unaware that he and billions of others human beings are connected neutrally to a virtual reality world known as the Matrix. Over time and with the help of <a href=\"/morpheus/4005-52464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52464\">Morpheus</a>, <a href=\"/trinity/4005-52463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52463\">Trinity</a>, as well as others, Neo comes to accept that everything he previously knew was a lie. Neo becomes less of a lazy slacker going through the same thing over and over again, and evolves into an incredibly powerful character with insane martial arts ability and a purpose, which is fulfilling his destiny as \"The One\" and bringing about peace, ending a long war between humans and machines.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Matrix</h3><p>Thomas Anderson and everyone else \"living\" on planet <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a> are unbeknownst to them linked via their nervous system to the Matrix, a virtual reality world. In his day job, Thomas Anderson is a programmer for the software company Meta cortex. As a side job Thomas Anderson’s also a highly skilled computer hacker who breaks into computer systems illegally, swipes information, and then resells it, all under his hacker pseudonym \"Neo\". In the course of stealing and hacking, Neo learns about something known as \"The Matrix\" that keeps popping up and referenced in quite a bit of places.</p><p>For the past few years, Neo had been looking very hard to find out more information regarding \"The Martix\" and what it was, and everything that he could find lead him to one man described as a dangerous terrorist known simply as Morpheus. While at work in his cubical, Thomas Anderson (Neo) receives an envelope that was mailed to him. Upon opening the envelope up Neo finds a cell phone which proceeds to immediately ring. Answering the phone, Neo finds that Morpheus is on the other end and is looking to guide him to safety, claiming that \"They\" are coming for him. It turns out that multiple <a href=\"/agents/4060-52470/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52470\">Agents</a> of the Matrix, led by Mr. <a href=\"/agent-smith/4005-52466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52466\">Smith</a>, have come to arrest Neo and interrogate him about Morpheus and the Matrix.</p><p>Following the capture of Neo, and not getting the information they want from him, the Agents insert an electronic bug inside Neo’s body that will enable them to follow Neo wherever he goes and find the people that want to contact him. After being released by the Agents, Neo receives a call from Morpheus explaining that he has been looking for Neo his entire life as he believes Neo to be \"The One\". Morpheus directs Neo to a meeting place where Trinity and a few others loyal to Morpheus wait to remove the bug from his body and take him to finally meet Morpheus.</p><p>During Neo’s meeting, Morpheus explains about the Matrix and the truth about Neo’s entire life, that no one will accept being told the truth, that they must see it for themselves. Morpheus then offers Neo the choice between two pills, a <a href=\"/red-pill/4055-52465/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-52465\">Red Pill</a> and a <a href=\"/blue-pill/4055-54946/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54946\">Blue Pill</a>. Accepting the Blue Pill will cause Neo to go back to his normal life, living within the Matrix and being unaware of it. Taking the Red Pill will disconnect Neo’s neural connection from the Matrix. Neo chooses to swallow the Red Pill, Morpheus leads him into another room where other members of his crew await. Neo’s body is then covered with a weird liquid metallic which works its way into his throat as Apoc is able to locate Neo’s body outside the Matrix.</p><p>Neo awakens to find himself in a cocoon connected to many wires which provide the human body with everything it requires to live, the biggest of which is connected to the back of his head and serves as the neural connection to the Matrix. Looking around the place he is in, Neo finds countless other cocoons that also contain human bodies, those still connected to the Matrix. A flying machine creature grabs Neo and causes the connection in the back of his head to release him; this triggers an opening in the bottom of the cocoon which propels Neo down a long slide and into a tiny body of water. As his muscles are still too weak due to atrophy, Neo finds that he cannot keep himself afloat and is about to drown but is saved from drowning by Morpheus, and brought aboard his ship the Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p>Upon waking up Neo notices the voice of Morpheus and Trinity talking about finding \"him\" and questions if he is dead, to which Morpheus replies \"Far from it.\" Tank and Morpheus then set about fixing Neo’s muscles from the effects of atrophy using acupuncture, and Neo finds that his eyes hurt and Morpheus explains that it is the very first time Neo has ever used them. Once Neo is able to walk around, Morpheus gives him a tour of the ship as he explains in detail what the Matrix is, before connecting Neo and himself into a training program similar to the Matrix known as the Construct.</p><p>During the course of Morpheus teaching Neo about the Matrix, he also learns of the Agents and how dangerous they are, that all the humans connect to the Matrix are used as a power source for the machines. Morpheus goes on to tell Neo that someone will eventually have to fight the Agents, Neo notices that Morpheus is referring to him and finds out about \"The One\" who has been foretold to end the war going on between humans and machines outside the Matrix, Neo learns that Morpheus believes he is it.</p><p>The following day Neo starts his training sessions where he learns numerous combat forms and many programs are directly uploaded into his brain regarding the ship’s operations. Neo faces off against Morpheus to test his abilities while the crew watches to see if Neo really is \"The One\". Much to their and his own disappointment, Neo is defeated in sparing and fails to \"free up\" his mind enough to jump across a long distance between two buildings.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2674172\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674172-images__2_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.74903474903475\" data-width=\"259\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 259px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674172-images__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2674172\"><img alt=\"Neo bends a spoon with his mind\" src=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674172-images__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674172-images__2_.jpg 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" data-width=\"259\"></a><figcaption>Neo bends a spoon with his mind</figcaption></figure><p>A few days later as Neo has grown more accustomed to life on the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus decides it is time to take him to see the <a href=\"/the-oracle/4005-52467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52467\">Oracle</a> and find out if Morpheus is right about Neo being The One. Neo and Morpheus travel back into the Matrix and to a seemingly ordinary rundown apartment building, once inside the Oracle’s apartment and as Neo is waiting to see the Oracle he meets a young boy who can seemingly bend metal spoons.</p><p>Neo is confused on how the young kid can do such a thing, but learns from him how to do it. The Oracle has been gifted with the ability of foresight within the Matrix, but she doesn't have good news for Neo. First, she tells him that he is not The One at that moment, even though Morpheus believes he is, because it appears Neo’s waiting for something first. Next, she informs Neo that there will be a moment in the future when he will have to choose between his own life and Morpheus’ life.</p><p>Going back to the hard line, which is the main exit to get out of the The Matrix, Neo and Morpheus are betrayed by Cypher, a member of Morpheus's crew that has made a deal with the Agents to put him back into the Matrix. Neo and Trinity then choose to go after the captured Morpheus, Neo bringing about the Oracle’s prophecy of choosing between himself and the life of Morpheus. During the rescue Neo faces off against Agent Jones, the two exchange gun fire and to the surprise of both Neo is also able to move fast enough to dodge bullets. Using a military attack helicopter, Neo and Trinity are successful in breaking Morpheus out, which only enforces his belief that Neo is indeed The One.</p><p>Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are able to reach an exit out of the Matrix but Neo isn't able to make it through and is trapped in a subway station with Agent Smith. Rather than run away like Morpheus told him to do during his training, and as every other human does, Neo decides to take a stand and fight against Smith.The two go back and forth, exchanging blows to the point that neither can gain an advantage, ultimately Agent Smith proves too much for Neo and overpowers him. Choosing to kill Neo by holding his head in front of an oncoming subway, but just as the subway is about to kill him Neo switches places with Agent Smith and puts him in the path of the subway which kills his current body, though that doesn't last long as Neo sees Smith posses the conductor of the subway. Neo decides to run away from this fight as Smith was more than he could handle alone.</p><p>Neo is chased by the agents including Smith to one of the exits of the Matrix, and just as he enters the room where the exit is he finds agent Smith waiting for him. Agent Smith proceeds to repeatedly shoot Neo directly in the chest, killing him. Agent Brown is told by Smith to check Neo’s body for vital signs but Brown is unable to find any and the agents walk away. Meanwhile in the real world, aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus and what remains of his crew are under attack by machines as Neo’s mind is still trapped within the Matrix. Over Neo’s seemingly dead body Trinity explains that the Oracle also made a prophecy about her, that she would fall in love and that person would be The One. Trinity tells Neo’s body that she loves him and leans in to kiss him. After Neo is kissed his body comes back alive, his heart beating and his lungs breathing.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2674164\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674164-images.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.74903474903475\" data-width=\"259\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 259px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674164-images.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2674164\"><img alt=\"Neo freezing bullets in mid-air\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674164-images.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2674164-images.jpg 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" data-width=\"259\"></a><figcaption>Neo freezing bullets in mid-air</figcaption></figure><p>Neo’s body also awakens back in the Matrix, much to the surprise of the three agents who turn around and open fire. In response to this action, Neo states \"No\" as he turns to face the oncoming barrage of bullets while raising his hand up to them. Concentrating upon it, Neo is able to slow down and completely stop every single bullet fired and freeze them in midair. Neo plucks one of the frozen bullets out of midair to examine it. Back on the Nebuchadnezzar, Morpheus realizes he was right about Neo and that he is clearly The One. In the Matrix Neo is now able to see the world as it really is, in computer code, in addition he can alter the code.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677159\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70305676855895\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2677159\"><img alt=\"Neo sees the coding of the Matrix\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Neo sees the coding of the Matrix\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/131703/2677159-images__1_.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Neo sees the coding of the Matrix</figcaption></figure><p>An enraged agent Smith charges at Neo and attempts to defeat him in hand to hand combat but Neo is able to casually thwart Smith with only one hand while not even looking at Smith, as Neo’s abilities within the Matrix have increased exponentially that he can perceive things at a much faster rate. A few seconds later Neo’s hand moves at beyond superhuman speed to grab agent Smith’s wrist and kicks him down an entire hallway. Neo then runs directly at agent Smith and leaps into his body, moving around and altering his code until he destroyed it. Exiting his body he glares at the remaining two agents, <a href=\"/agent-brown/4005-55846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55846\">Agent Brown</a> and <a href=\"/agent-jones/4005-55847/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55847\">Agent Jones</a>, as they flee in fear of him.</p><p>Neo is last seen making a phone call informing the machines that because of him the machines are afraid, that he plans to expose the Matrix for what it really is, that he’s going to release as many human beings as he possibly can. After hanging up the phone Neo proceeds to put on his sunglasses and fly away into the sky.</p><h3>The Matrix Reloaded</h3><p>Neo has a dream that Trinity is killed by an Agent, when he wakes up, he believes that he saw a glimpse of the future and fears for Trinity's life. When Trinity (who is laying beside him), asks him what's wrong, Neo tells her nothing is wrong.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Being connected with \"The Source\" allows Neo to bend the computer simulation's laws of physics, which manifests itself as superhuman abilities.</p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><p>He has shown the ability to punch through steel doors and lift cars with one hand. Because this occurs in the Matrix, it takes a certain strain on Neo in real life.</p><h3>Clairvoyance</h3><p>Neo displayed an uncanny ability in the second film to see events before they occur. When consulting the Oracle, she remarks that his journey into the One and transformation from being linked with the Matrix's system core has allowed him to \"look at the world without time.\"</p>",

Jackie was constantly bullied at school, even when he came home his was beaten by his father. Simply put, he was despised and everyone wanted to make his life miserable. But, that all changed when he met a pretty, blond named Eve. She was very sweet and Jackie always made her laugh. They became lovers, but one day she disappeared (later on it turns out it’s because she had become <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48767\" href=\"/three-face/4005-48767/\">Three Face</a>). Following the career path Eve said he’d be good at, Jackie become a comedian. Unfortunately, he was a lousy comedian nobody laughed at his jokes. Then as if an omen Owlman flew through the window of the comedy club. Owlman became his comedic shtick. Rising the ladder of fame quickly helped Owlman seek out the man who’s been poking fun at him and his teen sidekick Talon. This was unfortunate for both Jackie and his assistant Harley. Harley was killed by the masked maniac and Jackie’s face was slashed to resemble a clown. Now he calls himself Jokester.</p> <h2>Duela Dent</h2> <p>Duela Dent is the Daughter of Jackie and Eve, but was mostly raised by the Riddler and Three-Face. The relationship with her real father has grown strong again, until she brings in her new boyfriend, Talon. The Jokester is enraged by the fact that she’s gallivant with their enemy.</p> <h2>Three-Face</h2> <p>Evelyn Dent was one a beautiful young lady, but now has split personality issues much like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\" href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\">Two-Face</a>. She used to be Jackie’s lover and now she’s the Jokester’s lover once again.</p> <h2>Riddler</h2> <p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\" href=\"/riddler/4005-3718/\">Riddler</a> had created a family for himself made up of Three-Face and Duela Dent, but once the Jokester came along that seemed to fall apart.

His name in the movie is actually the Jester and he goes under a more jester theme. His mouth doesn't appear to be disfigured either.  <br /> <br />The Jester is one of the few remaining members left of Earth-3's Justice League. At the movie's beginning he is seen with the good Lex Luthor trying to steal the \"Quantum Trigger\" from the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41531\" href=\"/crime-syndicate-of-amerika/4060-41531/\">Crime Syndicate</a>. To give Luthor a chance to escape the Jester stays behind to hold off the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41717\" href=\"/white-martian/4005-41717/\">White Martian</a> and hid henchwoman, an altenate version of Hawkgirl. Jester is attacked and soon defeated, Harkgirl stabbing him through the stomach with her sword. Dying, and with only\"one more joke\" left, he pulls out a small bomb. The Jester died in the explosion but he took the White Martian and Hawkgirl with him, not to mention a large portion of the Crime Syndicate's building. <br /> <br />The Jester's headquarters (disguised as a toy factory) is used later by the good Lex to hide the Justice League from the Crime Syndicate. It was here that he was shown to have had a trained monkey named Harley, who Lex sadly informs of The Jester's death.  <br /> <br />Despite his short time on film the Jester is able to pull out a few tricks. He shows equipment like an acid-spitting scepters and explosives dangerous enough to destroy super villains. The Jester also displays some impressive acrobats in the film.  <br />   <p><br /></p>",

He is a leutenant in the Democratic Order Of Planets, assigned to assist Zapp Brannigan on board the Nimbus. He is unagressive by nature, and often knuckles under to even Zapp's most humiliating demands.</p><p>Since the males of his species are the ones who carry children, Kif once became accidentally impregnated with Leela's DNA when he was in a romantic \"receptive phase\" with Amy, only to be exposed to several other people when the hologram system malfunctioned.</p>",

    "deck": "Zuko is Prince of the Fire Nation in Avatar: The Last Airbender. He has a large scar on his face from being burned because he spoke out of turn at a war meeting. He is the current firelord and is a skilled swordsman as well as a firebender.",
    "description": "<h2>Early Life</h2><p>Prince Zuko was born into Fire Nation Royalty to Ursa and Ozai, who at the time was not the Fire Lord. Zuko growing up seemed to have a rocky relationship with his sister, Azula though the two did not have the hateful relationship of latter years. when Zuko was young, his uncle, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a>, went off to war, where he laid siege to Ba Sing Se. Along with his Uncle went Zuko's cousin, Lu Ten.</p><p>Growing up, Zuko grew to love his mother, while only wanting respect from his father, but his father sadly only paid attention to Zuko's Prodigal Sister, Azula. Azula, who had many malicious traits boarding on psychopathy. This trait made the two at odds, but Azula's friend, Mai, was Zuko's first infatuation. Mai also returned the feeling, and constantly mocked the two on it by making them do stupid stuff.</p><p>Zuko appears to have a fond memory of an event when he was eleven, when he and his mother were feeding the turtleducks. as his mother fed the ducks passively, Zuko demonstrated how Azula fed the turtleducks, and began throwing the bread at the ducklings. In response to this, he earned a chastizing from his mother and a bite on the leg from the mother turtleduck. When Zuko complains about the bite, his mother responds that that is just what a mother does when her babies are threatened, making a playful biting sound for effect. The two of them laugh and leave the pond.</p><p>As the two are walking towards the palace which they live in, they pass Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai all playing outside. Mai looks away ad blushes at Zuko, and Azula takes notice of them, Azula decides to humiliate them and asks her mother if Zuko would play with them. Dispite Zuko's protest, his mother sends him over to the girls. Azula then calls over Mai and places an apple on her head. Then, telling Zuko to get the apple, she sets it on fire. Zuko over-reacted and in his attempt to put out the fire, he knocked over Mai and himself into a fountain that Mai stood in front of. Azula and Ty Lee then came over and commented on how cute the two looked together. Zuko then stormed off, and when his mother commented on him being wet, he told her that \"Girls are crazy.\"</p><p>Later that day, the family gets a letter from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a>, who had just taken over the outer wall of Ba Sing Se. He then sends gifts to Zuko and Azula, a knife that the general used to surrender the wall for Zuko, and a Earth Kingdom doll to Azula. While Zuko recieves his gift with much happiness and immediately begins playing with it, Azula views her doll with disgust. She inquires if <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a> did not return, would Ozai become next in line for the position of Fire Lord. She immediately scolded by Zuko and Ursa, and she lets the matter drop, and instead burns her doll.</p><p>Later that year, another letter arrives from Ba Sing Se, but this one with a much different air. Zuko's cousin and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a>'s son, Lu Ten, was killed in battle at Ba Sing Se. This comes to a shock to both Ursa and Zuko, and even Azula turns her head in sorrow. Later, Azula tells Zuko that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a> is returning defeated after breaking down over his son's death. At that moment, Ursa walked into the room and told the two siblings that their father had requested a meeting Their grandfather, Fire Lord Azulon. Azula then makes a remark about not referring to him with as much respect, since he would probably die soon.</p><p>As Zuko and his family appear before the Fire Lord, Azula demonstrated her skills to her Grandfather, and in a jealous fit, Zuko shows his skills also. to both Azulon and Ozai's annoyance, Zuko's performance is clumzy, and he ends up falling trying one of the moves. Ursa attempts to comfort her son by telling him that he has the heart ofa warrior, for he never gives up in the face of a greater adversaty. Ozai then requests to tell the reason for his meeting, and Zuko, Ursa, and Azula begin to leave. Before Zuko has left, though, Azula pulls him behind a curtain to eavesdrop on Ozai's conversation.</p><p>Ozai tells of how <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a>'s right to the throne should be revoked and granted to him. He list his reasons as the loss of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Uncle Iroh</a>'s spirit after losing his son, and that the loss of his son, who was his only son, gave no heir after Iroh's death. Azulon responds to this suggestion with rage at his younger son. Azulon tells his son that such a proposalwas out of thequestion, and that he was a fool to say it. He then tells Ozai that he will be punished severely, and Zuko runs off to his room.</p><p>Azula comes in a short time later, saying that Ozai is going to kill him, literally. She then tells of howAzulon had told Ozai that he would feel the pain of losing a first-born son. Ursa then comes in andasks about what is going on. She takes Azula out of the room, and Zuko is left alone in his room, telling himself that \"Azula always lies.\"</p><p>Later that night, Zuko is woken up by his mother, and she tells him that she has done everything for him, and she leaves forever. Azulon was found dead the next day, though it is unknown if Ursa killed him. At hi funeral Ozai was crowned king, the Sage telling the crowd that it was under Azulon's own wish.</p><p>At the age of 13, Zuko went to a war meeting and spoke against General's plans to sacrifice Fire Nation men. This was considered an act against the Fire Nation itself so Zuko had to duel his own father. Refusing to fight his father, he gained a burned scar on his face and exiled from the Fire Nation until he could capture the Avatar.</p><h2>Hunt for the Avatar/Book 1: Water</h2><p>Zuko and his Uncle Iroh spend over two years hunting the Avatar. All they have is a ship and a small crew of men. None of them are high quality soldiers at all. While searching in the south pole, the Avatar(Aang) set off a trap that shot a flare in the sky. Seein the flare Zuko sees the Avatar and finds him staying at a Southern Water Tribe village. He is suprised to find that Aang is only a boy, and is a little bit dissappointed. Aang comes with him Zuko without fighting becuase he didn't want the water tribe getting hurt. But when Sokka and Katara show up on Aang's pet Appa he escapes.</p><p>After this event, Zuko had to bring his ship in to a Fire Nation port for repairs. Zhoa, is head of this port and during this time discovers that the Avatar had returned. He decides that he wants to capture him for himself but before Zuko leaves, Zhoa and Zuko have a dual which Zuko wins. Since this event, Zuko and Zhoa are now rivals in capturing the Avatar.</p><p>Later, the Avatar is captured by Zhoa, because Zuko has to bring the Avatar in himself to get his honor back he gets masks and breaks into the Fire Nation base as the Blue Spirit. Aang and Zuko work together trying to escape form the base, Aang doesn't know its Zuko. After Zuko is knocked unconscious by an Arrow, Aang removed his mask to discover that it is Zuko who saved him. Aang then takes Zuko with him so that he wouldn't be discovered by Zhao. But after Zuko wakes up he attacks the Avatar who escapes to save his friends.</p><p>Continuing his journey a bounty hunter named Jun rides her Shirshu, a creature with a tongue that can paralize people for periods of time, onto his ship. The Shirshu sniffs out a stowaway on Zuko's ship that she is hunting. She tells Zuko that her Shirshu can sniff out people from miles away. Using Katara's necklace, Zuko found earlier, he uses her Shirshu to hunt down Aang. They first find Sokka and Katara but Katara had a peice of paper Aang had held on her and they were able to find Aang. Zuko battles Aang but ends up losing when Sokka tricks the Shirshu by spreading smells in the air, the Shirshu sees by smelling. Blinded the Shirshu hit Zuko and June with its tongue. Unlce Iroh pretended to be paralized as well. Aang and his friends then escaped.</p><p>Whe Zhao plans to go to battle against the Northern Water Tribe, he comes to Zuko's ship to recuirt all his men. While on Zuko's ship Zhao sees the swords that the Blue Spirit used and realized that Zuko is the Blue Spirit. To get Zuko back, Zhao hired so pirates to kill him. The pirates sunk onto Zuko's ship and blew it up, but Zuko was able to survive the explosion. Zuko then snuck onto Zhao's ship so he could go with him to capture the Avatar in the North Pole. Uncle Iroh told Zhao he would go with him to help him defeat the water tribe, but really he knew about Zuko and wanted to watch over him.</p><p>When Zhao's ship made it to the North Pole, Zuko snuck into the Water Tribe City and found the Avatar unable to defend himself cause his Spirit was in the Spirit World. After defeating Katar who was trying to protect Aang, Zuko kidnapped Aang and ran off into a blizzard. But because of the blizzard, Zuko had to hide in a cave from the storm. Before the storm stops, Aang comes back to his body and escapes when Katara and Sokka find him. Zuko's was too tired to defeat Katara for a second time. But Aang couldn't leave Zuko out in the blizzard and brought him back with them.</p><p>When Zhao attacked the moon spirit, Zuko used this chance to escape. While running from the city he ran into Zhao. Angered by Zhao's attempt to kill him the two men battle. But when the Spirit of the Ocean grabbed Zhao, Zuko attempted to save him but Zhao refused the help and drowned in the ocean. Zuko and his Uncle the escaped from the North Pole on driftwood.</p><h2>Self-Discovery/Book 2: Earth</h2><p>At drifting for weeks Zuko and his Uncle had finally found a chance to relax on land. But Zuko was wanting the Avatar more then ever, becuase it was the three year anniversary of when Zuko was banished by his father. But unknown to Zuko, his father has declared him and his Uncle traitors to the Fire Nation. He has also sent Zuko's sister, Azula, out to capture Zuko and Iroh. Azula's first attempt to capture them is she tells Zuko and Iroh ant Ozai has ended the exile he has on them. Zuko is almost over come by this, though his Uncle Iroh has his doubts. They agree to go with Azula but when they are about to board her ship, one of her men accidently lets the plan slip that Zuko and Iroh are actually prisonors. A battle breaks out with Zuko, battling his sister. He is defeat and is about to be finished off by a lightning attack when Iroh, redirects it and Zuko and Iroh escape. Then they both cut the thier topknots off, showing they are cutting their tie off with their family.</p><p>Having problems being fugatives, Iroh accidently ate a poisonous planet. Seaking aid form an Earth Kingdom woman named, Song, Iroh is saved. While at Song's house she tries many times to reach out to Zuko, but the closest she gets is when she shows Zuko the scar on her leg given to her by the Fire Nation. Although Song had been so kind, Zuko steals her Song’s ostrich horse.</p><p>As their sistuation gets worst, Zuko can barely watch and his uncle has to ask people for money. Not able to take it anymore, Zuko uses the Blue Spirit mask to steal from villagers. When Iroh worries about how he is getting the supplies he asks him about his honor. Iroh believes that even after capturing the Avatar now would not bring Zuko back his honor in his father's eyes. Zuko angered leaves and when he returns tells his Unle that neither of them have anything to gain from travelling together anymore. Zuko then leaves his Uncle Iroh behind.</p><p>While travelling alone, Zuko came to a Earth Kingdom town where some Earth Kingdom soldiers were bothering the town's people. Zuko stands up to the soldiers and they run off. A boy named Lee is impressed and tells Zuko that he should go to his family's farm. Zuko agrees and helps out around the farm in exchange for food and shelter. Before leaving Zuko offers Lee, the dagger his Uncle had given him. While Zuko was leaving the town, Lee's mother ran to him. She tells Zuko, how the soldiers came back and took Lee when he decided to fight them using the knife Zuko had given him. Zuko shows up and defeats the soldiers easily except for their leader who is a Earth Bender. Zuko was trying to aviod using Fire Bending so he wouldn't reveal who he was, but he couldn't defeat the Earth Bender without it. Zuko proudly tells them all who he is, but even after saving them, the town's poeple reject Zuko for how he is. Even Lee throws away the knife Zuko had given him.</p><p>Zuko tracks down his sister to a town, where she is about to battle Aang. He demands that the Avatar is his to capture and the three of them all battle each other. Zuko is hit and seems to be in trouble when Aang's friends show up as well as Iroh, who has been following Zuko without him knowing it. The six of them corner Azula, and she gives up. Right when she is about to leave she hits Iroh with a blast and leaves him badly injured. Aang and his friends offer to help, but Zuko angered and hurt demands they leave them.</p><p>After taking care of his Uncle, Zuko asks him to continue Zuko's training so he can defeat Azula. Iroh attempts to teach Zuko the lightning attack, but because of his inner battle he is unable to learn it. Instead Iroh teaches a move he made up from watching water benders. It was the move he used to redirect Azula's lightning attack. But when Iroh said it was too dangerous to try out, Zuko went to the top of a mountain during a thunderstorm and shouted at the sky and the world becuase it wouldn't strike him down. He then passed out.</p><p>Zuko and Iroh start heading to Ba Sing Se, on their way they make it to a desert oasis, where a secert group Iroh is a member of tells them the Fire Nation has a huge bounty on them. The group helps them make their way to the captail city of the Earth Kingdom, Ba Sing Se. While on the boat to Ba Sing Se, Zuko meets Jet. Together, Zuko and Jet's gang, steal food form the ship captain. After arrving, Jet offers Zuko a place in his gang, but Zuko turns him down. Jet notices Iroh use firebending to warm his tea. Zuko and Iroh find a place to live, but Zuko hates it cause he feels like a prisonor in Ba Sing Se. They both work at a tea shop, and Jet makes several attempts to prove they are firebenders. Nobody belives him, so finally he challenges Iroh and Zuko to battle, hoping that one of them would have to firebend to defend themself. Zuko accepts and uses his dual swords to battle Jet. Finally the Dai Li break up the fight and witnesses say Jet attacked Zuko and his uncle. So Jet got arrested, and Zuko was free to continue working with his uncle.</p><p>One of the teashop's regular customers, a young girl named Jin, gets a crush on Zuko and Iroh sets up a date for them. Zuko seems pretty akward throughout the whole thing but towards the end, he lights a bunch of candles by a fountain for her. She kisses him but he stops it only saying, \"Its complicated.\" Zuko quickly returns home and Iroh asks him how it went, but Zuko slams his door behind him. He then slides it open slowly and replies, \"It was nice.\"</p><p>Zuko soon learns that Aang and his group are in Ba Sing Se, when he sees a flier put up by them searching for Appa. Zuko gets the idea that if he can capture Appa, he can bait Aang to coming to him. Zuko once again uses the Blue Spirit and forces a Dai Li soldier into telling him where Appa is. He then sneaks into the Dai Li secret base and finds Appa. Suddenly Uncle Iroh appears and asks Zuko what he is doing. Iroh asks him if he had thought about what he is going to do with Appa once he has him. He then tells him that he needs to stop hunting the Avatar and find his own way to live his life. Confused and angered, Zuko shouts but then lets Appa go free. He the drops his Blue Spirit mask into the lake.</p><p>When Zuko and his uncle returned home, Zuko devloped a fever and fell down. Iroh told him that the battle about his future has now started effecting his body. Iroh tells him that after his fever passes, Zuko will finally be the person he was ment to be. Zuko has sevearl dreams while he is sick. One of them he is the Fire Lord and no longer has his scar. There are two dragons, one with his sister's voice and one with his uncle's and they both are giving him advice. Another one is pictures of his dead mother crying for his help. Zuko awakens and spashes some water on his face. Then he goes and looks in the mirror and see that he has Aang's head and tatoos. Zuko finally truly wakes up screaming in horror and feels that he still has his scar.</p><p>After Zuko has gone through his chage he seems to be more optimistic and enjoys life. He is also excited about Iroh opening up his own teashop and the invation they got to serve tea to the Earth King. However, the invation is a trap set up by Azula and the Dai Li to capture Iroh and Zuko and to overthrow the Earth King. Zuko and Iroh are able to fight their way free but Zuko decides to stay behind to face Azula. She laughs at him and have the Dai Li arrest him and throw him in the cave prison with Katara. Katara starts shouting at Zuko, blaming him for everything. He just sits there and takes it all in until she says that the Fire Nation took her mother away from her. Zuko tells her how the Fire Nation has taken his mother from him as well, and she says she is sorry and that for a long time he has been the face of the enemy. He touches his scar and she offers to heal his scar, but before she can Aang and Iroh show up to save them.</p><p>Zuko is about to attack Aang just due to the site of him, but his Uncle stops him and Katara and Aang leave. Iroh asks Zuko once again to give up his search for the Avatar but Azula shows up with the Dai Li and surroud Iroh in crystals. Azula asks Zuko for his help capturing the Avatar whil Iroh asks him to accept his own destiny. Azula leaves to fight Aang and Katara, but Zuko later joins her and attacks Aang. At the end of the battle, Azula strikes a deadly blow on Aang and before Katara and Aang are capture Iroh shows up to save them. Iroh fights off Zuko and Azula until Katara is able to leave with Aang, then he allows himself to be captured by the Dai Li. Later, Zuko seems unsure about his choice to capture the Avatar. He says that he has betrayed Uncle. But Azula tells him that it was Uncle who had betrayed him.</p><h2>Book 3: Fire</h2><p>In Book 3 Zuko regains redemption from his father, but only because Azula told him that Zuko killed the Avatar (Aang). When he asks why Azula points out how letting him have all the glory over slaying the Avatar could do very little benefit for her, but goes on to insidiously acknowledge the fact that should it be discovered that the Avatar was alive, all that glory would swiftly turn into shame and foolishness. With that he goes to see the Combustion Man telling him to kill the Avatar, believing he is still alive.</p><p>Later Zuko finds a letter telling him to learn about his great-grandfathers demise. Knowing about Sozin's demise and believing the note to be from Uncle Iroh, he goes visits him. Iroh says that he was not talking about Sozin but Roku, his mother's grandfather. Iroh believes since he has Sozin and Avatar Roku's blood running through him he is morally conflicted between sides. He believes it is Zuko's destiny to restore peace to the world. Iroh then gives Zuko Roku's crown which was given to Roku by Sozin.</p><p>During the Day of Black Sun, Zuko finally comes to realize that his true destiny is to join the Avatar and restore balance to the world. After leaving a note to Mai, Zuko confronts his father Ozai. He tells Ozai how cruel a man he was to burn and banish him, and how terrible the Fire Nation has become during the last hundred years. Zuko then announces his intention to join the Avatar and after denouncing Ozai as his father, saying that his uncle Iroh was more of a father than him, he swears to his father that he will be defeated. Before he departs, Ozai tells him the truth about his mother's fate. He reveals that she wasn't killed, but banished for treason, giving Zuko hope of seeing her again. When the eclipse ends, Ozai attacks Zuko with lightning, but he redirects it back at Ozai and leaves before he recovers.</p><p>After following the Gaang in a hot air baloon, Zuko appears to them at the Western Air Temple and offers to teach Aang firebending. Unfortunately, everyone except Toph is unwilling to trust him, forcing him to retreat back to his campsite. While he is gone however, the Combustion Man arrives at the temple and attempts to kill Aang again. Zuko tries to make him stop, but to no avail, and Sokka ends up defeating him. After earning Aang's trust and joining him, Zuko seems proud of himself, but Katara confronts him with a warning. If Zuko shows any sign of going back to his old ways, she will kill him personally.</p><p>In the latest episode of the show, it has been shown that the Gaang has excepted Zuko as a member, and he was passing tea around that he made to all of them. Sokka asks can he talk with Zuko, and Sokka asks where they might be keeping his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53814\" href=\"/hakoda/4005-53814/\">Hakoda</a>. Zuko tells him they'll most probably be keeping him captive on the Boiling Rock, and when Sokka tries to sneak out in the morning, Zuko is prepared, and tells him they shouldn't take Appa but rather his Fire Nation War Baloon. The two travel to the Boiling Rock, and adopt cover as guards. Zuko asks around to see if they're keeping any war ciminals captive, but they're not, but instead the duo find Suki. Later, Zuko stands guard as Sokka talks to Suki in her cell. When a guard tries to enter her cell, Zuko begins battling her, and when the guard sees Sokka, she tells him to arrest Zuko, which he does so they're plan can go on. Zuko is visited in his cell by the prison's warden, Mai's uncle. Later, he Firebends so he's able to get into a cooler to unbolt it, so the small gang can use it as a boat. But when Sokka here that a new shipment of criminals are arriving tomorrow, including war criminals, which could mean his father, he decides to stay as do Suki and Zuko.</p><p>Hakoda arrives, and the small gang plan another escape. This includes starting a riot, and getting onboard a gondala that carries prisoners in with a hostage so the guards won't cut the rope. Shortly before the plan is put into action, Zuko is visited by Mai, who is outraged that he left and only left her a letter. When a guard arrives, who has been assigned to protect Mai because the riot, Zuko uses this to his advantage makes the guard jump in front of Mai, and locks them both in the cell. Outside when he catches up with the others, he begins to argue with Sokka about how they'll capture the hostage they need (the Warden). Suki manages to do this, and the gang jump onboard a gondala. They are persued by Azula and Ty Lee, and Zuko battles Azula with Sokka. The Warden manages to break out of his restraints for a second and shouts to the guards to cut it, which they begin to do. Ty Lee and Azula bail, and Zuko saves Sokka in return most probably for saving his earlier. Luckily, as they're cutting the ropes, Mai shows up and beats them all up, and Zuko and the others are able to escape.</p><p>Zuko then went on an adventure with Katara to find her mother. Zuko said he knew who did the raids and that he would take her to them. Katara eventually found the man who took her mother and was close to killing him with blood bending but stopped herself. After the little journey, Katara finally was at peace with Zuko since she knew that he too lost his mother because of the war.</p><p>After they returned the Western Air Temple was attacked by Azula and Zuko decided to stay behind for a bit to fight her. Zuko fell off the war balloon and Azula thought that she had finally defeated him. But Zuko appeared to be riding on Appa as the group flew away to safety to Zuko's old vacation home.</p><p>While at the home, Sokka came across an ad for a play about the avatar.They all decide that they should see the play in order to enjoy themselves. The play, however, was not what they expected at all. First of all, Zuko's burn was on the wrong side of his face and that his character and Katara's had feelings for each other. The part that scared Zuko the most was when they portrayed Azula killing him. The Gang left the play all feeling worse about the out come that laid ahead.</p><p>The next morning Aang was missing and they searched all over the land near Zuko's house to find him. When they found no trace of him, Zuko remembered a woman who could find Aang. They go to a bar where a woman bounty hunter who has helped out Zuko before is. She searches for Aang but tells them that he is gone. Then Zuko asks her to find his Uncle Iroh and she easily does that. They enter the campof the White Lotus and the old masters tell Zuko that his uncle is sleeping in his tent. Zuko enters the tent and waits for his Uncle to wake up, when he does Zuko apologizes telling Uncle that he doesn't expect him to forgive him. Zuko is shocked when Uncle responds with a hug telling Zuko that he never really was angry with him, just dissapointed that he lost his way. During breakfast, Zuko tells Uncle that he is the only one who can defeat the Fire Lord with Aang missing. Uncle explains that he can't do that because it will be more senseless violence and the only the avatar can end the war peacefully. Uncle warns Zuko that he is the one who must stop Azula and that he'll need help. Zuko decides to take Katara with him and they leave quickly.</p><p>Zuko and Katara interrupt Azula's crowning just before she is deemed Fire Lord. Azula knows that she can't beat them both so she challenges Zuko to a duel which he accepts because he notices something is off about Azula. They duel a great battle of blue and red fire which Zuko slowly gets the upper hand on. He questions her on why she isn't fire lightning at him because she's afraid that he'll redirect it. Azula was just about to fire the lightning she conjured at Zuko when she noticed Katara standing on the sidelines. Azula instead fires at her but Zuko jumps in the way of the lightning saving Katara. Katara rushed forward to help Zuko but is cut off by Azula. Katara leads Azula on a chase that ends on a drain and a chain in Katara's hand. Just before Azula was about to strike Katara, Katara freezes the water around them. She slowly thaws out the water while chaining Azula to the drain below making her helpless. Katara then runs over to Zuko and heals the wound on his chest from the lightning.</p><p>After the Fire Lord is defeated by Aang, Zuko was crowned the new Fire Lord. He and Mai rekindle their relationship but Zuko recieves a threat from her if he ever dumps her again. Everyone is at Uncle's tea shop enjoying themselves, when Sokka announces a picture he drew of the moment. Zuko is annoyed that his hair is very spiky.</p><h3>After the Hundred Year War</h3><p>Zuko aided in what was known as the Harmony Restoration Movement which moved the colonials back to the Fire Nation. Zuko made a deal with Aang that if he saw Zuko was turning into Ozai, Aang would kill him. Zuko would meet with a mayor of a village. The mayor would make statements that Zuko was a coward and a traitor to his people and that his father was better than him. Zuko retaliated and attacked the mayor, ordering him to be seized. The mayor's wife stopped them with earthbending and asked for forgiveness on her husband's behalf. Zuko saw that the city was already merging of different cultures and he pulled out of the Harmony Restoration Movement. As Aang and Katara heard about this, they decided to enter Yu Dao but needed permission first which resulted in them being attacked. Zuko managed to grab a hold of Katara and Aang was angered by this told him to let her go in which he replied they must stop attacking first. Aang separated them with airbending and went into the Avatar state. Katara calmed him down and Zuko settled down and showed them the integrated community. Zuko agreed to a conversation with Kuei and when he returned home Mai mentioned he could always talk with her if he needed to since he was looking exhausted and warn down. Zuko, restless, decided to make tea and go visit his father in prison for advice.</p><h2>After the Series</h2><p>Alongside Avatar Aang, Zuko would establish Republic City at the site of the Fire Nation colonies. Zuko would serve as Firelord for many years but stepped down and appointed his daughter as the new Firelord. By the time of the Legend of Korra series 75 years after the arrival of Sozin's comet Zuko would be still alive traveling the world as an unofficial ambassador for peace. A statue for Zuko can be seen in Republic City's Central City Station as a testament to his accomplishments.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>While initially the series' main antagonist, over time Zuko's development has shown him to be more of a bitter and complex young man than a truly evil character; he is far closer to an anti-hero than a true villain. Zuko wanted, more than anything, to have his place as heir to the Fire Nation throne and his father's love. Zuko believed, or has perhaps forced himself to believe, that capturing the Avatar will make these wishes come true, which made him one of Aang's most determined enemies.</p><p>Zuko believes that a person becomes strong by having to struggle and fight for what they want. He has said that he does not want to have good luck, because he feels he can control his own fate. He also believes that he is marked unlucky and that the world is against him. Zuko's reaction to this perception of the world always being set against him is defiance in the form of an iron will and inflexible determination. Zuko is clever yet hot-headed, often letting his temper get the best of him. He rarely thinks his situations through, causing him to get in trouble numerous times, such as when he captured Aang at the North Pole and could only walk into a blizzard afterwards, or when he took the Sun Stone off its pedestal in the Sun Warriors' temple and fell into a trap. These traits are criticized by his uncle Iroh, and he appears to be trying to get more control of himself and think things through more towards the end of season three.</p><p>Zuko has numerous contradictory traits, beliefs, and behaviors. For example, he is domineering and controlling, a result of being raised as Fire Nation royalty, and disdains working with people that he believes are inferior to him. Despite this, he adamantly refuses to view people as expendable. It was Zuko's belief that it is wrong to sacrifice able-bodied and willing troops as a diversionary tactic which led to his exile when he voiced his opinion and angered his father. During his banishment, Zuko displayed much zeal in pursuing the Avatar, using whatever means he thought necessary to gain the upper hand. Although he has said that the capture of the Avatar is a greater concern to him than the safety of his crew or even himself, he shows compassion to those close to him, choosing to rescue Iroh when he was captured, rather than pursue Aang, and also risked his own life in order to save a member of his crew during a fierce storm. Towards the end of the storm, the crew spots Aang, but rather than chase the Avatar, Zuko orders the ship and crew to safety.</p><p>Because the prospect of returning home and being forgiven was Zuko's sole motivation, he is marked by abject despair at having lost his chance early in the second book. He finds himself in perhaps the most dire situation possible--being hunted by his sister, the ruthless and relentless Azula, while attempting to survive as a penniless fugitive in the Earth Kingdom. Zuko has nothing, something he cannot seem to accept. At first, Zuko lashes out and turns to robbery, even stealing from those who have been kind to him. After some time, however, partially in thanks to a talk from Iroh, Zuko gains a more reasonable outlook. Although theft is still necessary from time to time, he refuses to steal from already needy people, or people who have shown him kindness. He also defended an Earth Kingdom village against a group of thugs who terrorized its people after having been appointed to protect them. Zuko begins becoming more patient, kind, precise, and calculating; traits necessary to evade Azula's pursuit while staying incognito from local authorities. During \" Lake Laogai\", he even sets Aang's pet bison and primary mode of transportation, Appa, free from Dai Li captivity at Iroh's suggestion.</p><p>These traits would become dominant after Zuko's fever dreams and hallucinations in \" The Earth King\", as afterwards he displayed a more optimistic attitude towards life and the world. However, Azula successfully tapped into and manipulated Zuko's desire for the love and approval of his father, and convinced him to betray Iroh and become her ally in \" The Crossroads of Destiny\". Although Zuko continued to insist that he had truly changed, he afterwards seems conflicted about his choices, and is uncomfortable with his betrayal of Iroh, who is a father figure to him.</p><p>After his return to the Fire Nation, Zuko thinks he has everything he ever wanted: a position of honor, respect, and his father's love. However, he still feels angry and confused. He feels that his triumph is nothing like he imagined. In The Beach, Zuko's temper goes out of control; he becomes suspicious of Mai, and gets into fights with several people. Later, he states that he is angry with himself, saying he doesn't know right from wrong. In \" The Avatar and the Fire Lord\", Zuko receives a letter, telling him that his great-grandfather's death would reveal his destiny. Zuko finds Sozin's last testament, and learns of his secret history with Avatar Roku. He comes to his uncle, demanding to know the meaning of the message. Iroh tells him that Avatar Roku is his mother's grandfather, and that Zuko's inner conflict is due to the good and evil natures that he inherited from Roku and Sozin respectively. Iroh then gives Zuko an ancient crown, worn only by the crowned prince of the Fire Nation.</p><p>In \" Nightmares and Daydreams\" he became upset when he wasn't informed of a war meeting in which his sister was invited, and shown happiness when a servant later came and asked Zuko to head to the war room, as Ozai would not start the meeting without him. Much later, he told Mai that he found himself unhappy, even when his father treated him as the perfect son. He says that during the meeting, he had acted the perfect prince, the son his father always wanted, but he was not being himself.</p><p>During the events of Day of Black Sun, Zuko comes to realize that he must restore peace to the world by joining the Avatar and fighting the tyranny of his nation. He discards his previous beliefs in the Fire Nation's greatness and swears to his father that he will be defeated. He then attempts to free his uncle from prison, but when Iroh escapes himself, Zuko follows Aang and the others as they flee to the Western Air Temple.</p><p>While at the Western Air Temple, Zuko shows a complete change in personality. After a flashback of his banishment, he is shown being regretful about his former disrespect and ruthlessness. He even, for the first time, begins to show a comical side to his personality. This is shown when he practices a speech to say to the Avatar to a frog. After questioning what Iroh and Azula would do in his situation, he tries to impersonate them. He later admits his wrongdoings to Team Avatar, and apologizes for the things he did to them.</p><p>Rather than trying to capture the Avatar for the Fire Nation's benefit, Zuko attempts to join him to end his nation's tyranny. While he used to attack Aang whenever they met, he instead defends him from the assassin that he hired to kill the Avatar. He has also come to realize that his father could never restore to him his honor, and that he has to restore it himself. Zuko is even very happy when the Avatar finally accepts him as his Firebending teacher and group member. Though Zuko still has some issues to work through, he is far more composed and receptive. Since coming to terms with his own true feelings he has become a much more laid-back and empathic person. After joining the group he smiles a lot more than usual, even when jokes are made at his expense, and during the Series Finale, he seems to be very happy as the Fire Lord as he has a break in his uncle's tea shop.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Zuko has numerous amounts of techniques when it comes to offensive actions in his arsenal, and is basically always prepared to fight, be it with flashes of flames or his dual blades in which he has shown extreme precision with in many instances, be it with sliding stolen cups into a satchel to defeating bandits in foreign regions of the world.</p><h3>Firebending</h3><p>Throughout the series, Zuko has shown himself to be a highly skilled Firebender, and his skill has grown as the series has progressed.</p><p>As a child he could only create small bursts of flame, but by the time he was thirteen he was confident enough in his abilities to readily accept a challenge of Agni Kai, (he refused to fight, however, when he found out his challenger was his father).</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:ZukoFireS1.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:ZukoFireS1.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/3/35/ZukoFireS1.png/250px-ZukoFireS1.png\" alt=\"250px-ZukoFireS1.png\" /></a></p><p>At the beginning of the series he is still learning the basics from Iroh, and is skilled enough to momentarily knock Aang off his ship, and is only defeated when Aang goes into the Avatar State. By episode 3, he utilizes what he has been taught to defeat Zhao, who is older, more experienced and a master Firebender. Throughout Book One, he demonstrates his skill many times; he defeats multiple foes both in \" The Warriors of Kyoshi\" and in \" Winter Solstice Part 1: The Spirit World\". Later on in Book One, Zuko's skill grows. During \" Bato of the Water Tribe\" he fares well in a duel against Aang, being able to deliver multiple fire blasts for a sustained period without tiring, and is only defeated when he is paralyzed by June's confused Shirshu. In \" The Waterbending Master\", he creates a shield of fire in order to protect himself from a massive explosion on his ship. During the Book One finale he fights Katara while the moon is full . Zuko not only hold his own against her, but at one point briefly gains the upper hand until the sunrise, when he easily defeats her with one fire-blast . He also lands a decisive victory in a rematch against Zhao.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:ZukoFireS2.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:ZukoFireS2.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/e/ef/ZukoFireS2.png/250px-ZukoFireS2.png\" alt=\"250px-ZukoFireS2.png\" /></a></p><p>During the course of Book 2, Zuko's Firebending becomes much more advanced and powerful. In \" The Avatar State\", he is unable to land any blows against Azula, and is defeated rather easily. He fares somewhat better during \" The Chase\"; in a three-way battle with Azula and Aang, he trades several fire blasts with his sister and keeps the Avatar on the defensive. As Book Two progresses, he learns more advanced Firebending techniques from Iroh. He becomes more efficient and refined as a result of this. During a battle with the Rough Rhinos, he sends a small bolt of fire through Vachir's bow, breaking the string. He also demonstrates the ability to fire multiple small blasts through two fingers, rather than his whole fist, during \" Tales of Ba Sing Se\". During the Season Two finale, he demonstrates how far his prowess has grown. His fire blasts have become more powerful, and he is shown charging his attacks before releasing them, creating enormous blasts of fire. He also demonstrates the ability to create two long whips of fire. He is able to battle evenly with Aang, even though Aang had been skillfully using both Airbending and Earthbending. Later, after switching opponents with Azula, he battles evenly with Katara, who had long since been declared a Master.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:ZukoFireS3.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:ZukoFireS3.png/\"><img src=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/e/ea/ZukoFireS3.png/250px-ZukoFireS3.png\" alt=\"250px-ZukoFireS3.png\" /></a></p><p>Little was seen of Zuko's Firebending in the first half of book 3; however, Zuko is confident enough in his abilities that he offers to teach Aang. In \" The Western Air Temple\" he utilizes a wall of flame to stop a combustion attack, and is capable of dodging many of Toph's rocks which she hurls at him. Later, in \" The Firebending Masters\", Zuko temporarily loses his ability to Firebend due to his corresponding lack of rage, which had formerly been the source of his power while he was pursuing the Avatar. However, after viewing the multi-colored flames of the two dragons, he finds a new source of power in reverence for fire's power as a source of life and energy. He also learns \"The Dancing Dragon\", an ancient Firebending form that he performs alongside Aang. Learning this form appears to have influenced his style of Firebending to be more fluid, creating a more dance-like form as opposed to the rigid, militaristic forms commonly used by Fire Nation soldiers. His difference in style and skill is demonstrated in the conclusion of \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\", where he briefly battles against Azula alongside Sokka. During the fight, he deflects many of Azula's fire-blasts with only his arms or his own fire, and trades fire balls with her. In \" The Southern Raiders\", Zuko faced Azula again, and dueled her , what appeared to be evenly for several minutes. He fires several large, powerful fire blasts, and deflects many of her attacks. In \" Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King\" Zuko attacked Aang with powerful fire blasts, in order to make him fight backWhen he'd chaced him ionto a house, Zuko created several lashes of fire, used them to envelop his surroundings, then augmented the fire to take the shape of the hallway Aang was running through. With the power of Sozin's comet, Zuko's Firebending was tremendously enhanced. During \" Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into The Inferno\" he fought Azula one final time in an Agni Kai, unleashing extremely powerful sheets of flame. This time Zuko held the upper hand, exchanging and blocking attacks with Azula without visible strain while Azula was pushed towards exhaustion, although it is unclear how much of this was due to Azula's mental instability at the time. He displayed several incredibly powerful techniques. He was able to block an enormous stream of fire with a short fire-blast, which spread to take the shape of a wall and split apart the stream. He unleashed an enormous charged-blast, which Azula was unable to block, forcing her to dodge. He propelled himself into the air, charged his fire, then sent down a fire attack as he came down. His final attack consisted of a fire tornado that he created with his feet while spinning which knocked Azula off her feet.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:ZukoFireFinale.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:ZukoFireFinale.png/\"><img src=\"http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/c/ce/ZukoFireFinale.png/250px-ZukoFireFinale.png\" alt=\"250px-ZukoFireFinale.png\" /></a></p><p>In \" Zuko Alone\", he used his Firebending in conjunction with his broadswords. He has also demonstrated use of Fire Daggers and limited use of Breath of Fire.</p><p>During his training with Iroh he attempted to learn how to create lightning. However, because of his inner turmoil, he was unable to achieve the required peace of mind, and his attempts to produce lightning would only explode in his face. Instead, Iroh taught him how to absorb and redirect lightning. He later employed this technique against his father during Day of Black Sun and against Azula to protect Katara in Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into The Inferno. In the latter engagement Zuko redirected the blast despite not being in the proper stance as he had jumped into the lightning's path, but failed to redirect all of the lightning. Though Zuko seems to have overcome his inner turmoil, he was not shown creating lightning for the remainder of the series.</p><h3>Other Skills</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Zuko-sword.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Zuko-sword.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/4/4f/Zuko-sword.png/250px-Zuko-sword.png\" alt=\"250px-Zuko-sword.png\" /></a></p><p>In addition to his Firebending, Zuko is a master of his dual Dao blades, a skill he picked up during his years at sea. He would use his Dao swords whenever he was in his Blue Spirit disguise. During \" The Blue Spirit\", he was able to defeat multiple foes using only his swords. He also dueled evenly with Jet and his dual hook swords in \" City of Walls and Secrets\", until the fight was broken up by the Dai Li and Jet was arrested. During \" Zuko Alone\" Zuko defeated several Earth Kingdom soldiers with his Dao swords and minimum effort, only resorting to Firebending when faced with a powerful Earthbender; even then he was able to hold off the Earthbender's attacks for several moments with only his blades. His skill was such that his father, Fire Lord Ozai, opted not to face against him during an eclipse, while neither of them could Firebend.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Zuko-wall-run.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Zuko-wall-run.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/5/51/Zuko-wall-run.png/250px-Zuko-wall-run.png\" alt=\"250px-Zuko-wall-run.png\" /></a></p><p>Zuko is physically very strong, fast and agile. He is capable of great physical feats, such as running across walls, and climbing very quickly. He is apparently skilled in unarmed combat, able to break apart oncoming spears with his hands and legs, and disarm, subdue or defeat opponents. As shown in \" The Blue Spirit\", \" The Siege of the North, Part 1\", \" Lake Laogai\" \" The Avatar and the Fire Lord\" and \" The Southern Raiders\", Zuko is skilled at infiltration, and can sneak into heavily-defended fortresses. He is also skilled at stealth, and can conceal himself effectively for long periods of time. All of these skills would serve him while he was disguised as the Blue Spirit. Zuko was also a skilled tracker, able to track the airborne Avatar all across the world.</p><p>While not as naturally adept at strategy and academics as his sister, Zuko is quite intelligent. Throughout the series, he has demonstrated himself to be a skilled strategist, able to exploit any situation to his advantage. In \" Winter Solstice Part 2: Avatar Roku\", Zuko used his ship's damages as a smokescreen to conceal his movements from Zhao. He was also able to form alliances with people with special skills, such as June, and use them to his advantage. However, he had a hot-headed nature that caused him to not always think his actions through. For example, he could exploit advantages in the Northern Water Tribe, and get into the Spirit Oasis to capture Aang, but he didn't figure a way back out which caused him to almost freeze to death. Zuko began to think things out more towards the end of the series, and he started to plan things out and think ahead to solve problems more often. When he and Aang needed to get in a specific room in the Sun Warrior ruins, Zuko was able to outsmart the Celestial Calendar, as it would only allow the room to open during a solstice. This intelligence may come to serve him as he rules the Fire Nation.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Brief History<br /></h2>Paralyzer was recruited by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\" href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\">          Magneto</a> alongside four other mutants which  included <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14554\" href=\"/burner/4005-14554/\">         Burner</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14557\" href=\"/slither/4005-14557/\">        Slither</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19354\" href=\"/peepers/4005-19354/\">       Peeper</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14555\" href=\"/lifter/4005-14555/\">      Lifter</a>. Magneto and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\" href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\">     Captain  America</a> responded to a newspaper ad that stated a mutant needed  sensitive persons or agencies equipped to help provide a home  environment and care. Both men met a man that had possessed a tiny,  minute mutant he called Mister One inside his wrist watch. Magneto  attempted to steal this mutant because it possessed great mental  abilities but came into conflict with Mister Two who was Mister One's  bigger protector. Magneto returned back to his base and told his mutant  band his plan to steal the tiny mutant and called it Operation Grab. Paralyzer and the rest of his fellow mutants attacked Mister Two and  Captain America when they were outside the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\" href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\">    SHIELD</a> medical facility. Paralyzer displayed his mutant abilities when he grabbed Mister  Two and unleashed a powerful, electric current that laid out his foe. Paralyzer and the rest of the group retreated when SHIELD members  appear but it allowed Magneto the diversion he needed to steal Mister  One from the SHIELD medical lab. Paralyzer would engage with Captain  America and Mister Two when they infiltrated Magneto's lair. Mister One  activated a bomb where Paralyzer and the rest of Magneto's mutant squad had  disappeared after the explosion.<br /><h2>Creation<br /></h2>Paralyzer was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\" href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\">              Jack Kirby</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2510\" href=\"/captain-america-annual/4050-2510/\">             Captain America Annual</a> # 4. <br /><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<br /></h2>Paralyzer has two pincer claws and is capable of unleashing a powerful, electric current when he grabs his enemies or shoots a paralyzing blast for range attacks that can stun an opponent. Paralyzer claims he has mastery over electricity and displayed that talent when he resurrected the living dynamo named Zzzax to become his slave. His claws are strong enough to tear flesh, bones and other materials like wood and soft metals. ",

    "deck": "Aang, last of the Air Nomads, is the Avatar, a perpetually reincarnated being charged with the spiritual guidance of the world. Aang must master all four elements (Earth, Air, Water and Fire) and defeat the Fire Lord before the arrival of Sozin's comet, or the Fire Nation will dominate the world.",
    "description": "<h2>Over a 100 years ago</h2><p>When Aang was still young, he was given a bunch of toys to choose from. Based off of the four toys that he chose, it was revealed that he was the new Avatar, the one who would master all four elements. Aang was raised by the Airbending monks in the Southern Air Temple.</p><p>Soon after discovering he was the Avatar, his friends didn't want to play with him because they thought he had an unfair advantage in games. The only one that wanted what was best for Aang was Monk Gyatso. The other elder Monks thought their relationship was dangerous to Aang's development as the Avatar and decided to send him to the Eastern Air Temple to further hone his Airbending prowess. Scared and confused, Aang took his flying bison, Appa, and ran away. As he was traveling away from the Southern Air Temple Aang got caught in a storm near the south pole. In attempt to save himself and Appa, Aang entered the Avatar state and froze him and Appa in ice with a combination of Airbending and Waterbending.</p><h2><u>100 years later/Book 1: Water</u></h2><p>While fishing, <a href=\"/katara/4005-25622/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25622\">Katara</a> and her brother <a href=\"/sokka/4005-47733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47733\">Sokka</a> found Aang in the block of ice. They took him to their Water Villiage. While playing around Aang set off a trap that revealed his location to <a href=\"/zuko/4005-47634/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47634\">Prince Zuko</a>, a <a href=\"/fire-nation/4060-48047/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48047\">Fire Nation</a> prince who was sentenced to hunting down the Avatar. When Zuko arrived, Aang turned himself in so the Fire Benders wouldn't attack the people of the Water Village.</p><p>Katara and Sokka went after Aang and helped him escape and flew away on Appa. The three then started heading to the North Pole so Katara, a water bender, and Aang could learn water bending together. On their way, they came across the Southern Air Temple and Aang finally believed that he was the Last Airbender. All of his friends had been killed by the Fire Nation. Enraged he entered the Avatar state and unintentionally began surrounding himself with powerful winds. He finally came out of the state when Katara managed calmed him down.</p><h2><u>The North Pole</u></h2><p>When \"Team Avatar\" finally made it to the North Pole, Aang is introduce to Pakku, who is a water bending master. He said that he would teach Aang water bending and also agreed to teach Aang's friend. But when he found out that Aang's friend was Katara, a female, he declared that he would not for women were forbidden to water bend in the Northern Water Tribe. After a duel with Katara and learning of her grandmother, Pokku changed his mind and agreed to teach Katara too.</p><p>This would not last very long because soon after the Fire Nation began attacking the North Pole. In an attempt to learn the forms of the moon and ocean spirits, Aang enetered the spirit world. While in the Spirit World, Zuko attacked Katara and kidnapped Aang's body. While in the Spirit World, Aang had to go see the spirit Koh. After learning who the spirits were from Koh, Aang returned to his body only to find he is kidnapped by Zuko. Zuko was too weak to stop him from escaping when Aang's friends showed up. By the time Aang makes it to the spirit of the Ocean and Moon, he is too late. General Zhao, kills the spirit of the moon, which triggers Aang to enter the Avatar State. While in the state, Aang was able to defeat the Fire Nation Navy Fleet by himself.</p><h2><u>Book 2: Earth</u></h2><p>After his victory at the North Pole, Aang's next stop is to head to Omashu to learn Earthbending. Before they do they make a stop at and <a href=\"/earth-kingdom/4060-48048/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48048\">Earth Kingdom</a> base where the General there thinks that Aang should enter the Avatar State and defeat the Fire Lord now. After many attempts, avatar <a href=\"/avatar-roku/4005-52564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52564\">Roku's</a> spirit comes to Aang to tell him what the Avatar State is. It is the spirit, knowledge, and power of ever past life of the Avatar. But if Aang is killed in the Avatar State, the Avatar will be gone forever.</p><p>After finally making it to Omashu, Aang learns that the great Earth Kingdom city has been taken over by the Fire Nation. After sneaking in Aang is captured by the resistance there, and helps them escape from the city. Aang then continues his search for a teacher.</p><h2><u>Toph</u></h2><p>While in search for a teacher, Aang comes to see and Earthbending tournament where he sees a blind bender easily defeat her opponent. Aang thinks that she would be the perfect teacher and after doing some research finds that her name is Toph and where she lives. When going to her house, they find that she has over protective parents, but they are eventually able to get <a href=\"/toph/4005-47732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47732\">Toph</a> to agree to train Aang.</p><h2><u>Vital Information</u></h2><p>While traveling the group came across a library, where a great spirit named Wan Shi Tong has gained all kinds of knowledge of the world. Toph decided not go in because, she can't read the books or see in the library. Wan Shi Tong was initially fairly hostile towards the children, but agreed to let them use the library after they promised no to use its information to harm anybody. While the others were in the library, they discovered that the next solar eclipse would make the Fire Nation helpless. When Wan Shi Tong learned that they were using its information to defeat an opponent he decided to bury the whole library with them in it. Toph tried to hold the library up with Earthbending. While she was doing this, some Sandbenders came and kidnapped <a href=\"/appa/4005-47769/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47769\">Appa</a>.</p><p>Aang is furious and blamed Toph for not saving Appa, and leaves the group to search for him. But after searching for hours he eventually returns to the group. They finally make it through the desert where Toph identifies the Sandbenders. Aang enters the Avatar state and demands to know where Appa is. Scared, the Sandbenders tell them that they traded him and that he should be in Ba Sing Se already where he will be sold.</p><h2><u>Ba Sing Se</u></h2><p>On their way to <a href=\"/ba-sing-se/4020-52254/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52254\">Ba Sing Se</a>, they come across some refugees who tell Aang and his friends of a Ferry that can take them to <a href=\"/ba-sing-se/4020-52254/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52254\">Ba Sing Se</a>. With Toph's status as a Bei Fong, they are able to get passes but Aang learns that the refugees who helped them got rejected. Aang tells them that he will help them through the Serpent's Pass. After many trials through the passes Aang and his group make it through the pass and to ba Sing Se.</p><p>While approaching the Great Outer Wall of the city, Aang sees a Fire Nation drill attempting to cut its way through the wall. Aang and his friends stop the drill and defeat <a href=\"/princess-azula/4005-47768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47768\">Azula</a>, Zuko's sister, from making their way into Ba Sing Se.</p><p>When they finally enter <a href=\"/ba-sing-se/4020-52254/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52254\">Ba Sing Se</a> Aang and his friends get greeted by Joo Dee, a woman who was assigined to guide them around the city. They attempt to tell her about the war and that they need to see the Earth King, but she simply ignores them, until they arrive at they're house, where she tells them that they meeting with the king is eing processed and will be put through in 6-8 weeks.</p><p>When the <a href=\"/the-gaang/4060-47860/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47860\">Gaang</a> gain entry to the Earth King's pet bear, Bosco's birthday party, they are taken away by the Dai Li. There they're leader, Long Feng, threatens them, and they are taken out, by a woman claiming to be Joo De too.</p><p>The Gaang spend most of this time looking for Appa, and Aang and Katara find a printer. They put up posters around the city, and when the old Joo Dee shows up to tell them they're unable to post posters around the city, Aang shouts at her. The Gaang are then approached by Jet, claiming to know where Appa is.</p><p>After Smellerbee and Longshot see Jet, they all realise that he's been brainwashed. They manage to figure out, with the help of Katara's healing, that something's going on in Lake Laogai. They go to visit there, and they all take on the Dai Li, and in the end, they find Appa.</p><p>Next, the Gaang go to tell the Earth King about the war and conspiracy, and eventually, Long Feng is arrested. In the final battle in the catacombs of Old Ba Sing Se, it is thought that Aang is killed while in the Avatar State, but luckily, is saved by being healed by Katara with the water from the Spirit Oasis.</p><h2><u>Book Three: Fire</u></h2><p>At the beginning, Aang finds himself on a Fire Nation ship which turns out to be controlled By the gang. Pipsqueak, the Duke, and Hakoda and other waterbenders were also on board.</p><p>Later on when it's just the gang they are in a forest. An old woman named Hama lets them stay at her house after telling them of a spirit that was taking people. When Hama wasn't home, they went snooping through the house. Toph metalbended a locked door open they find a locked chest. After they try to open it Hama appears and opens it for them. She reveals it to be a comb from the Southern Water Tribe. When Katara is training with Hama, Toph Sokka and Aang go to the hill wheree Toph heard screams. They find people in a cave, locked in chains. They find out that the spirit is actually Hama. Sokka and Aang go after hama while Toph unlocks the people. When they arrive Hama bloodbends them to attack Katara. When Katara attaches Aang and Sokka on different trees with ice, Hama breaks them free with them heading toward each other and Sokkas sword heading at Aang. Katara stops them just in time and bloodbends Hama into the defeat. When Hama is arrested she says her work is done by teaching Katara bloodbending. Katara then breaks down into tears and Aang and Sokka run to comfort her.</p><p>The gang decide to rest for awhile. When it is mentioned that there are only for days before the Invasion of the Fire Nation Aang starts to stress out. One night he has a nightmare when he comfronts Firelord Ozai but he forgets his pants. The next night he has his pants in the nightmare but he has to take a math test. Katara, Sokka, and Toph try to help him out. Katara tries to help Aang by doing yoga in steam but fails.</p><p>Next Sokka tries to talk to Aang about his feeling about the Invasion. This doesn't work and Sokka suggest to scream in a pillow, which is a koala sheep. This fails to and Toph is next. Toph tries to help Aang by laying him on earth shaped logs. She then gives him a brutal massage but can't take the pain. She then suggest acupuncture with a boarcupine but Aang runs away. After the three's failed attempts Aang decides not to sleep. Aang is now having continuous daydreams like kissing Katara and seeing Momo and Appa fight like samurais.</p><p>Aang now exhausted wanders across a bed made of wool. He thinks its another daydream but Katara, Sokka, and Toph show up and tell him its not. They used the wool from the koala-sheep to make it. Aang tells them he's not ready but they insist on sleeping on the bed. Aang falls asleep and has a dream where Firelord Ozai forgot his pants instead.</p><p>The morning of the Black Sun their friends and allies come. The Mechanist from the Northern Air Temple has created a new glider for Aang that comes with a snack compartment! When it's time for Sokka to tell the plan he gets extremely nervous. His father takes his place and gets everybody excited. Sokka tells Aang that that was his time to prove himself Aang reasures him that his time will be on the battlefield. To get ready for the battle Aang shaves his head showing his arrow again. Sadly the invasion failed and the elders who were part of the invasion stayed behind while the children went with Aang and the rest of the gang to the western air temple. When they arrived there so did Zuko wanting to join them and be aang's fire instructor to teach him fire bending. Aang and the rest of them struggled to accept him because of their past confrentations with him but shortly after accepted him into the group. Then came the final events, Firelord Ozai had decided to leave the fire nation to azula and for him to rule the world calling him the phoenix king. Aang had consistantly trained for this day so he went after the firelord on the day the of Sozin's Comet and uses it's powers to try to finish the war, But Aang comes face to face with Ozai and defeats him once and for all by bending not the elements but the energy within him. And just when that fight was going on Katara had defeated Azula. While a group of elders called the Order of the White Lotus reclaims Ba Sing Se. At the conclusion of the series, Zuko becomes the new Firelord and him and Aang end up being friends. Together, they vow to restore peace throughout the world which had been suffering so long.</p><h2>After the Series</h2><p>Avatar Aang and his friends would go on to do great things during their lifetimes, Aang and Firelord Zuko would use the Fire Nation colonies as a basis for forming Republic City where people of all nations, benders and non benders could cooperate and thrive as a symbol of peace. Aang himself would establish Air Temple Island in the bay as a new Air Sanctuary and a place for his family. Aang and Katara would marry and have 3 children together, Kya (a female waterbender named after Katara's mother), Bumi (a non bender named after Aang's good friend and King of Omashu), and Tenzin (Aang's youngest son and only airbender). Aang served the city until his death at the age of 66, a fairly early death compared to some other Avatar's lifespans, like Avatar Kyoshi. Aang's death is said to have been caused by his continuous use of the Avatar State for 100 years, which severely depleted his chi.. The next Avatar to be born is a female named Korra in the Southern Water Tribe. She has finally unlocked her Airbending and spiritual blocks after having her other three bending abilities removed by Amon. These abilities were restored by Aang.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712229-untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712229\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6820652173913\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712229-untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712229\"><img alt=\"Airbending\" src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33935/712229-untitled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712229-untitled.jpg 368w, https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33935/712229-untitled.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Airbending</figcaption></figure><p>Aang is naturally an Airbender, and became a master at a very young age. At a young age he created his own Airbending move called the Air Scooter, which allows him to travel at high speeds. Aang is not only an Airbender, but the Avatar, a bender with the ability to master all four elements, and the bridge between the physical world and the spririt world.</p><p>Apparel</p><p>Aang most commonly wears his traditional monk robes. He has tatoos all around his body covering his arms, legs, back, and head. While secretly living in the fire nation he was disguised in a fire nation student's uniform including a headband to cover up his arrow. He carries around a staff which increases his control and precision over air while bending. Lastly, Aang travels with a Bison whistle used to call over Appa, which he can hear from surprisingly far distances.</p><p><strong>Airbending</strong></p><p>As an airbender, Aang has shown mastery in his primary and native bending skill. He has shown the capability to create domes of compacted air to defend against arrows or the ability to run \"as fast as the winds.\" Throughout the series, his mastery has become more evident when he has shown himself capable of fighting master benders of other arts (such as Azula) using his Airbending most of the time. In season 3, he's shown himself capable of making small tornadoes/cyclones, or sending out a gust of air from his lungs similar to Avatar Roku. Although Airbending has no sub-art, Aang has shown himself to capable of increasing the pitch of his bison whistle while looking for Appa, to the point where animals all over Ba Sing Se could hear it.</p><p>When he enters the avatar state, he can create a dome of air in which he may fly around in. The dome is powerful enough to withstand high-speed impacts into columns of solid rock or into the ground ( to the point where he creates a crater) and can withstand the flames generated by Ozai while he was enhanced by Sozin's Comet. He can also create winds that can erode solid rock.</p><p><b>Waterbending</b></p><p>Waterbending was the second art Aang learned to use and mastered. As the Avatar, he's a natural when it comes to Waterbending. When he first started. Katara taught him a move that took her a few months, but only took him a few seconds. Not to mention his was bigger and better. Throughout the series, we see he's an excellent Waterbender, capable of bending entire streams or creating shields of ice. He has shown himself to capable of creating a huge wave that sends him from the middle of the ocean to an extinct volcano (with help from Yue, the moon spirit, but he maintains the huge wave himself) or using ice as stepping stones. In his regular sate, he is a Waterbending master, yet Katara is more prone to using her skills to their fullest extent since it's her only element. She eventually becomes Aang's teacher again (after she's reached the status of master Waterbender) and learns moves such as Bloodbending which Aang has yet to show knowledge of.</p><p>When in the Avatar State, however, Aang is the most powerful Waterbender. He has shown himself capable of compressing water and using it to extinguish flames generated by Ozai during Sozin's Comet. Possibly the greatest technique of Waterbender ever shown in the series was during the Siege of the North, when the moon spirit was killed by Zhao. Aang enters the Avatar State and fuses with the ocean spirit. In turn, he becomes a giant fish creature made of blue water, with Aang in the center, controlling the monster through Waterbending. In this form, he takes on a massive army of fire navy ships, with no hassle, and destroys them all. In this form, he was capable of bending massive amounts of water at one time.</p><p><b>Earthbending</b></p><p>Earthbending was the last art Aang learned, but the third he mastered. He's shown himself to have trouble with it as it is his natural opposite element. Whereas Airbending is about evading and finding a different method to things,Earthbending is about being stable and facing things head-on. Despite this, he shown a great proficiency in the art. Being trained by Toph, one of the greatest Earthbenders in the series, helps contribute to this. While Earthbending, he showed himself capable of creating slabs of rocks for cover from attacks. As the series progresses, Earthbending becomes one of his most used elements. He can use it to create an armor of rock to cover his entire body or just his hand, crash through rock columns by Earthbending (while he was fighting Combustion Man), and sense things through the vibration of the Earth just as Toph can. While also airbending, he was capable of creating a zoo made of earth, with very fine details in it. However, he hasn't shown himself to be able to Metalbend.</p><p>While in the Avatar State, he showed himself of moving rocks from distance while being in the air, without having to be connected to the ground. When he was fighting Ozai, he compacted giant clumps of rock into smaller pieces, which he could break apart and fire like bullets, which had enough destructive force to destroy several rock columns, despite their size.</p><p><b>Firebending</b></p><p>Firebending is the third Aang learns, but the only one he didn't have enough time to master. He first learned firebending from Jeong Jeong, as he thought it to be the only time he could learn it. Jeong Jeong wasn't too keen on him not mastering Waterbending yet or learning Earthbending, but Avatar Roku persuaded him into teaching Aang. Aang was a little too anxious and excited about Firebending when finally was capable of creating a flame and controlling it. From this, he decided to send out a huge burst of flame which hit Katara burning her hands (thankfully, she was able to learn how to heal using Waterbending in this very same episode.) After this, Aang vowed to never use Firebending again.</p><p>After a talk with Guru Pathik, Aang realized as the avatar, he must learn Firebending. When Zuko joins his group and decides to teach Aang Firebending, they both go the ancient Sun Warrior's ruins to try and learn Firebending from the original source. They learn from the original source, two dragons, that firebending isn't about using hate and anger to overpower enemies. From this, they also learn the dancing dragon, in which they learn a technical series of dance moves that help the user fight around the enemies' attacks. It seems to incorporate some Airbending philosophies.</p><p>During his fight with Ozai during Sozin's comet, he was capable of creating giant streams of fire using jabs and kicks. When he entered the Avatar State, he's shown himself capable of bending lava, and creating great streams of fire from each limb and his mouth.</p><p><b>Energybending</b></p><p>An art long forgotten and taught to Aang by a giant Lion turtle. Before the Avatar came to be, people didn't bend the elements, but the energy within themselves. As of now only the Avatar can perform such an art, and few have learned it, while fewer have even used it. While energy bending, the Avatar may take one's bending (he has also been shown to restore bending as seen in the Legend of Korra episode, \"Endgame.\".) The user must have a stronger will than the one it's being used on, or else they will become corrupted with the other's energy and be destroyed. While Energybending, the user wants to have the dominant will so their energy will become dominant and fulfill the user's request.</p><p>Throughtout the seasons, Aang has managed to master Waterbending and Earthbending, and is beginning to learn Firebending.</p><p>Aang has the ability to access the Avatar State, a state which he enters when under great pressure. In this state, his eyes and tatoos glow, and the knowledge of all past Avatars are channeled through him, allowing him to access amazing power through having the ability to bend every element because of his past lives knowledge.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712236-sebgsd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712236\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5033333333333\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712236-sebgsd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712236\"><img alt=\"Firebending\" src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712236-sebgsd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33935/712236-sebgsd.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Firebending</figcaption></figure><p>For more information on Air, Water, Earth and Firebending, please visit the <a href=\"/benders/4015-52146/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52146\">Benders</a> page.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>Aang's greatest strength and greatest weakness is the ability to go into the Avatar State.

He was raised by the chieftan of the clan MacLeod, Ian MacLeod. Ian gave him as a gift to his wife, when she lost another child during birth. His father raised him to ascend to his position. He had him trained as a warrior, diplomat, and scholar, proud that his son excelled at all. Yet it was at combat that he excelled them most, though he was a gentle soul.</p><p>During his 30th year of Life, his clan became embroiled in yet another dispute with it's neighbors. Unable to come to a civil decision, the dispute erupted into violence. At the beheast of his father, Duncan was chosen to lead his people in the conflict. During the course of the battle, though he equiped himself well, Duncan fell. After his death he was revived, as are all <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55923\" href=\"/the-immortals/4060-55923/\" slug=\"the-immortals\">immortals</a>. Denouncing him as a demon his father and mother disowned him.</p><p>Yet things would work out for Duncan, as his destiny truly began. Found by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47561\" href=\"/connor-macleod/4005-47561/\" slug=\"connor-macleod\">Connor Macleod</a>, who explianed to Duncan who and what he was, he began his new life. Connor would become Duncan's mentor and guide throughout his life as an Immortal. Duncan lived though many wars and times of conflict including witnessing the French Revolution, the Battle of Waterloo and fought in both World Wars.</p><p>During his life Duncan would meet many people who would influence his life, molding him into a great and powerful Immortal. Many of these are other Immortals: some of whom become mentors, some become friends and some become enemies. Though he starts out as a reckless, uneducated, and somewhat arrogant man, Duncan is able to gradually change during his life. He matures as he travels the world as with age, he becomes the wise, educated and compassionate character that we are introduved to during the present.</p><p>Having lived for centuries Duncan is an expert in many subjects, fluent in multiple languages and as necessary by his lifestyle is skilled in many forms of martial arts. Also as a consequence of his many lifetimes, he has been many things including a soldier, bodyguard, newspaper editor, World War I ambulance driver, chauffeur, and World War II Resistance fighter. Most recently during his life he has been an antiques dealer, a dojo owner and also a part-time History teacher.</p><p>Many of the greatest of the events of Duncan's life are recorded as happening during the years between 1992-1998. Joe's journal's show that Duncan returned to The Game after a period of semi-retirement with his girlfriend Tessa Noël and a meeting with clansman and mentor Connor MacLeod. Having returned to the Game, Duncan meets many old friends and enemies again, and manages to repay many old debts. Proving himself a skilled swordsman Duncan kills many Immortals.</p><p>Yet these times are also charachter building. He loses people he cares about, including Tessa, the love of his life and many of his friends. Sadly, Duncan befriends Richie Ryan, mentors him after his First Death and teaches him the ways of the Immortals much as Connor had for him. Events transpire that cause him to accidentally kill him in 1997, an event Duncan is shaken up about for a long time.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13340/300157-188987-duncan-macleod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-300157\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4925373134328\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13340/300157-188987-duncan-macleod.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-300157\"><img alt=\"Duncan MaCleod\" src=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13340/300157-188987-duncan-macleod.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static9.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13340/300157-188987-duncan-macleod.jpg 335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-width=\"335\"></a><figcaption>Duncan MaCleod</figcaption></figure><p>Duncan also meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65551\" href=\"/joe-dawson/4005-65551/\" slug=\"joe-dawson\">Joe Dawson</a>, who against the rules, reveals to him that there is an organization known as The Watchers who secretly observes all Immortals.

In an attempt to unite the Irish and Italian mobs, Peyton's father married her off to his enemy's heir, Johnny Sabatino. Peyton wound up being trapped in an abusive and loveless marriage with Sabatino, who also wound up being an inept mobster and did nothing to help unite the gangs.</p><p>When Sabatino was caught stealing money from <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ventriloquist-wesker/4005-5767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5767\">Scarface and Arnold Wesker - the Ventriloquist</a>, he and Peyton were about to be executed by <a href=\"/rhino/4005-5766/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5766\">Rhino</a> until Peyton began pleading with Scarface. The Ventriloquist took a liking to her and decided to let the two of them live, given that Sabatino gave him a 30% cut of all his future profits. This encounter allowed Sabatino to turn his life around and he became a much more successful criminal. Success went to his head however, and he decided to have Peyton and her father killed. Sean Riley was gunned down in a church, while Peyton was brought to an old tenement to be taken out by Sabatino and his thugs. Sabatino shot her in the head, while his thugs shot her several more times and then left her bleeding on the floor as they left. Shortly afterward, Peyton heard two more shots coming from the next room, where it turned out Wesker and Scarface had been murdered by the second <a href=\"/tally-man/4005-82107/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82107\">Tally Man</a>.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1419335\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69764397905759\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419335\"><img alt=\"A souvenir from Sabatino.\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg 764w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg 480w, http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/74863/1419335-peyton_06.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A souvenir from Sabatino.</figcaption></figure><p>After laboriously dragging herself into the next room, Peyton surprisingly found Scarface had begun talking to her - although she suspected she was simply hallucinating.

In a conversation with Wayne, Riley seems to shake off the Scarface personality and speaks to Wayne as her true self. Through this conversation she reveals that she knew Wayne, having been engaged to one of his friends -- Tommy Elliot, the man who became <a href=\"../../hush/29-9588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hush</a> -- and her name of Peyton Riley is revealed as well, as Bruce recognizes her. The Scarface personality, however, reasserts dominance over Peyton and hits her, deciding she was flirting with Wayne. In their hideout, Peyton goes on to talk of the rest of her origin, including her father and how Sabatino had him killed and tried to have her killed.</p><p>Later, aboard a yacht, Riley and Scarface decide to throw Sabatino overboard. <a href=\"../../zatanna/29-5691/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zatanna</a> shows up to save Wayne who dons his Batman disguise and saves Sabatino. Zatanna attempts to talk down Peyton, explaining to her that dolls have powerful magic but that such magic is no longer needed for Peyton to have her vengeance. Unfortunately before Zatanna can get through to Peyton, the magician is attacked by one of Scarface's bodyguards with an oar, forcing Batman to defend Zatanna. Peyton attempts to throw Sabatino overboard, but he attempts to strangle her until Scarface convinces her to heave them both overboard.</p><h4>Gotham Underground</h4><p>Peyton later resurfaces during the Gotham Underground Story Arc, when she teams up with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/lock-up/4005-25328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25328\">Lock-Up</a>, <a href=\"/firefly/4005-3733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3733\">Firefly</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/killer-moth/4005-8262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8262\">Killer Moth</a> under the orders of Scarface. The group learns from <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/scarecrow/4005-3726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3726\">Scarecrow</a> that the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/penguin/4005-4885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\">Penguin</a> is working for the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/suicide-squad/4060-40394/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\">Suicide Squad</a> who are rounding up villains to be sent off-world to the prison planet. However, upon learning the information, the group shun Scarecrow and move to an assault on the Penguin at the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-iceberg-lounge/4020-56813/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56813\">Iceberg Lounge</a> but are defeated by the Penguin's super-powered forces. Upon retreating, they meet Scarecrow once again who leads them to an alley to escape. However it is actually a betrayal and the group are ambushed by <a href=\"/whale/4005-34795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34795\">Tobias Whale</a>'s men who are out to cleanse Gotham from mask-themed villains and restore Gotham to its former glory (by belonging once more to the mob). Peyton ducks for cover as Tobias Whale's men begin to shoot while Scarface attempts to fight back and is gunned down. Peyton cries over the broken dummy while Tobias Whale comforts her. She tells him that anything she did wasn't her fault since she is under Scarface's influence, to which Tobias smiles and asks one of his men to escort her away. However it is a ruse and when she is out of earshot, Tobias tells his men that \"she is to be hurt, understand?\"</p><h2><span>Powers &amp; Abilities<br /></span></h2><p>Peyton Riley is a skilled criminal leader, although this manifests itself through Scarface. She is an accomplished ventriloquist, even able to pronounce her \"B's\" properly, something Wesker tended to have trouble with.</p><p>Scarface traditionally uses a 1930's Handgun or Tommy Gun.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gregor Dosynski was a comrade of KGBeast and became one of Batman's international foes. NKVDemon was targeting ten political figures in Russia who he felt betrayed the ideals of the USSR. Batman works with a Muscovite detective named Nikita Krakov to take down NKVDemon. Unfortunately, Batman and Nikita were unable to prevent the deaths of  Yuri Gregaroff (Politburo member), Vasily and Marsala Ramenki, Aleksey (Nikita's partner), Nichola Andronikov (agriculture minister), Pyotr Pushkin and Kropotkin (defense minister). NKVDemon has taken out everybody on his hit list except for one...President Mikhail Gorbachev himself. NKVDemon decides to assassinate the president on Earth Day. Batman prevents NKVDemon's chance to murder the president but NKVDemon scoffs at Batman because he knows about Batman's code of not killing and the only way NKVDemon will be stopped is if Batman is willing to cross that line. Fortunately, Batman distracts NKVDemon long enough for Nikita and the Moscow police to intercept him and end with a wave of gunfire.     <br />   <br />The second person to become the NKVDemon was a man named Nicodemus. He was hired by Jordan Wylie, a UN representative who wants Aquaman out of the way because Aquaman's political stance on the pollution of the world's oceans could effect his main source of income. When Nicodemus failed to kill Aquaman, Wylie hires a guard to kill Nicodemus in his prison cell. The guard is successful and the title of being the NKVDemon is passed on.      <br /> <br />The last person to take on the mantle of the NKVDemon is still unknown to this day. He was last seen as a bodyguard for the Odessa Mob, the Russian cartel in Gotham. The Odessa Mob was attending a summit between the rival gang bosses in Gotham. A shootout broke out between the rival gangs and NKVDemon was among the dead who were found at crime scene. Its possible that NKVDemon and Hellhound killed each other since their bodies were in close proximity of each other but how it was done remains unknown.   </p>",

    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>A soldier in <a href=\"/vietnam/4020-55927/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55927\">Vietnam</a>, Philip Reardon was honourably discharged from the <a href=\"/us-special-forces/4060-55045/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55045\">US Special Forces</a> when he was injured in a grenade blast which resulted in shrapnel being embedded between his eyes. Returning to the states and civilian life, Reardon took up work as a security guard. During his shift at the warehouse he was attacked by thieves, who knocked him out and planted a bomb. Awakening just before the bomb was set to go off, Reardon attacked the recently-arrived <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, believing in his disorientated state that Batman was working with the thieves. He recognized Batman for who he was just as the bomb exploded; the force of the bomb aggravated his war wound and rendered him permanently blind. He was attended to by Dr Engstrom, who moved his optic fibres to his fingertips, allowing him to see through his fingers. Driven by a desire for vengeance against Batman, who he blamed for his condition, Reardon turned to crime as the Ten-Eyed Man.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Villain</h3><p>The Ten-Eyed Man is hired by unknown persons to combat the <a href=\"/man-bat/4005-6131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6131\">Man-Bat</a>, but is injured when a shrub is thrown at him and he catches it, inadvertently wounding his \"eyes\". Later he clashes with Batman on two separate occasions, suffering defeats both times due to his \"eyes'\" sensitivity to touch and light. He is imprisoned and kept blind to prevent his escape.</p><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><p>The Ten-Eyed Man is killed during the chaos of the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>.</p><h3>Return</h3><p>Ten-Eyed Man is briefly summoned out of oblivion by <a href=\"/psycho-pirate/4005-25495/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25495\">Psycho-Pirate</a>.

    "description": "<h2><span>Fictional character biography</span></h2> <p>Darrin Profitt just happened to be one of six billion innocent bystanders in the <i>dreamscape</i> during a battle between the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\" href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" slug=\"justice-league-of-america\">Justice League</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10453\" href=\"/doctor-destiny/4005-10453/\" slug=\"doctor-destiny\">Doctor Destiny</a>. After the defeat of Doctor Destiny on the dreamplane, the Materioptikon gem on his chest sucks him inside and falls at the feet of Darrin Profitt's dreamself. Doctor Destiny's physical body is rendered catatonic and the Justice League wake up, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\" href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" slug=\"martian-manhunter\">Martian Manhunter </a>turns Destiny's body over to the custody of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/4020-31682/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a>. Darrin Profitt discovers that the gem is in his possession, and is accidentally sucked inside the artifact where he meets Doctor Destiny's trapped consciousness.</p> <p>According to Doctor Destiny, the <b>Materioptikon</b> has the ability to reshape reality, but it is flawed, anyone who enters the gem automatically generates multiple physical copies from multiple possible universes, splitting that person up among these universes. Also according to Doctor Destiny space and time was never meant to do this, using the gem in this fashion threatens the spacetime continuum. Destiny created special tools that re-integrate his own multiples and those of anyone else who enters the gem. In order to return to the real world without damaging reality, and generating any more dangerous alternate universes, Destiny stated that he had to repair all six billion flaws in the gem. Every time he repaired a flaw, he destroyed one of many possible universes and in all of them his body remained catatonic and dreaming in Arkham Asylum. Profitt overpowers Destiny and traps him in a facet of the gem, he then creates a few duplicates of himself using Doctor Destiny's tools and sends them out to place a bet at the race track and then invest that money in stocks, both the winners and losers return to the gem and report their results, he then uses the favorable results in his own reality. According to Doctor Destiny he endangered all of reality, all of Space and Time so that he could win a bet at the track.</p> <p>Darrin uses the parallels to create favorable outcomes one by sending his duplicates into a Parallel to test for a specific outcome, if they failed he deletes that Parallel, if they succeed he uses their solution. Darrin used the billions he'd made from manipulating the stock market via the Parallels to become a billionaire philanthropist and playboy.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Becoming the King</span></span></h3> <p>Due to boredom and in answer to a challenge posed by Doctor Destiny, he used the Parallels to acquire technology capable of defeating the Justice League and conquering the world. Under the guise of altruism his alternates prompt the scientists of their worlds to develop protocols for jamming JLA teleporters in case the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41469\" href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/4020-41469/\" slug=\"justice-league-watchtower\">Justice League Watchtower</a> is compromised, telepathic shields, satellites for tracking metahumans, cutting edge weapons and armor to take down H.I.V.E. cells, strategies for defeating alien invaders, renegade <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\" href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" slug=\"green-lantern-corps\">Green Lanterns</a>, rampaging <span>Bizarro</span>s, and rogue speedsters, coutermeasures against Themysciran magic in the event of an Amazon Attack, plans to construct and defuse theoretical Doomsday devices, and ways to isolate reproduce and implant the metagene in ordinary humans. The parallel Red Kings share their knowledge and in the end the Darrin Profitts of the three final realities of the Materioptikon don their liquid metal Red King armor and set out to conquer their realities. According to Profitt his three-to-one chances for success are very good odds. Profitt secretly kept a fourth Parallel hidden from Doctor Destiny in the event that the three Red Kings failed, this fourth Parallel's Profitt wore a different costume and called himself <span>Fallback</span>. This Profitt had a world in which he never changed anything from his life, and lived in the same state as he was before Doctor Destiny's battle, serving as a \"reset switch\" that would allow Profitt to go back to his beginnings if something failed. He was executed by another Red King, who had no interest in becoming a loser again.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Third Parallel</span></span></h3> <p>In the Third Parallel the Red King (3) uses one of his uncounted metahuman abilities to direct a swarm of meteors towards Earth. The unexpected kinetic bombardment wipes <a data-ref-id=\"4020-40924\" href=\"/keystone-city/4020-40924/\" slug=\"keystone-city\">Keystone City</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54995\" href=\"/central-city/4020-54995/\" slug=\"central-city\">Central City</a> off the map, killing the entire population of both cities along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\" href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" slug=\"batman\">Batman</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6270\" href=\"/plastic-man/4005-6270/\" slug=\"plastic-man\">Plastic Man</a>. The Red King (3) injects <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">Superman</a> with a newly created <i>Bizarro virus</i> that rapidly mutates him taking away his intellect. He then taps into the JLA Satellite's teleporter and scatters the League around the planet. He hits <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\" href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" slug=\"wally-west\">Wally West</a> with a beam that takes away his protective aura, so that the very act of running damages him faster than his healing factor can keep up with. He then beheads <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\" href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" slug=\"wonder-woman\">Wonder Woman</a>, crushes the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\" href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" slug=\"flash\">Flash</a>'s chest, and smashes <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\" href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" slug=\"john-stewart\">John Stewart.</a> He then defeats an assembly of responding heroes including the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" slug=\"justice-society-of-america\">Justice Society of America</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\" href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" slug=\"booster-gold\">Booster Gold</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5898\" href=\"/doctor-fate/4005-5898/\" slug=\"doctor-fate\">Doctor Fate</a>, all of whom he refers to as \"a collection of second stringers, benchwarmers and amateurs\". He heads to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\" href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\" slug=\"metropolis\">Metropolis</a> and calls out Superman, who can no longer think clearly due to the Bizarro virus. He is then blindsided by Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman in an attack co-ordinated by the Martian Manhunter who had faked their deaths, and assisted by Superman. Impatient and angry the Red King (3) releases a massive blast wave which vaporizes all the remaining League members leaving only the Batman who was apparently the Martian Manhunter masquerading as the dead hero. The Red King (3) incinerates the Martian Manhunter, and then sits in the ruins of Metropolis until nightfall. According to his assistant his blast wave destroyed every city on the planet and no one will ever trust him. The Red King (3) abandons that reality and then erases it from the Materioptikon.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Second Parallel</span></span></h3> <div> <div><div>In the Second Parallel, the Red King (2) projects a hologram above the city of Metropolis demanding the unconditional surrender of all Earth's governments or else he will trigger a Doomsday device and destroy the planet. During the middle of his speech the device prematurely activates apparently killing him, and the hologram disappears. Superman and the League discover that they have ninety-eight hours to evacuate the Earth. Superman, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter and Wonder Woman use their powers and advanced <span>Kryptonian</span> technology to terraform Mars. The Martian Manhunter links Wonder Woman's mind to that of everyone on Earth so she can tell them of the coming evacuation. Superman puts every criminal on Earth into the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42370\" href=\"/phantom-zone/4020-42370/\" slug=\"phantom-zone\">Phantom Zone</a>. The Flash (Wally West) and Plastic Man collect samples of every plant on Earth. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\" href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" slug=\"aquaman\">Aquaman</a> and John Stewart move most of Earth's oceans and sea life to the newly terraformed Mars. Wonder Woman talks earth's animals into peacefully co-existing on an alien \"Interestellar Ark\" until they get to Mars. Superman and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-34685\" href=\"/ray-palmer/4005-34685/\" slug=\"ray-palmer\">Ray Palmer</a> use White Dwarf Star Matter to shrink fifty-eight of Earth's most important cities and place them in bottles like <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41290\" href=\"/kandor/4020-41290/\" slug=\"kandor\">Kandor</a>, including Metropolis but not Central City or Keystone City. A fleet of alien ships summoned by the Green Lantern Corps help evacuate the planet but not everyone makes it off, Batman apparently dies as the planet explodes while confronting the Red King (2) near the center of the Earth, just before he dies Profitt apologizes for his mistake. Back on Mars, Batman returns alive with Profitt's accomplices and informs the league of what they need to do in order to stop the other Red Kings and do it before one of the other Red Kings erase their reality.<br/></div></div></div> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">First Parallel</span></span></h3> <p>This attempt to take over a Parallel by the Red King (1) begins well, the plan being to be asked and allowed to rule the world rather than to take it by force. This version helps the JLA defeat a newly empowered version of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-6905\" href=\"/royal-flush-gang/4060-6905/\" slug=\"royal-flush-gang\">Royal Flush Gang </a>on two separate occasions, after the second battle he is invited to become a member by Superman. Red King (1) begins to have a light romantic relationship with Wonder Woman that blooms once she learns he is Profitt (which in this Parallel was solving world hunger and had already known her for sometime). When Superman expressed some concern that Red King (1) possessed too much power for any one person, Green Lantern (John Stewart), stated that Red King(1) “probably wouldn’t even bother” working with the league if it wasn’t for Wonder Woman. The Martian Manhunter stated that he couldn’t read his mind, but Red King (1) genuinely seemed to care for Wonder Woman and she trusted him, so they decided they should trust him as well. This Parallel's League soon learned of the truth behind the Red King (1) when Batman learnt the comatose Doctor Destiny had been repeating his name over and over, the truth about the Parallels, and ultimately attacked him. Red King (1) defended himself but made an effort to solve the situation without violence, (asking them to surrender) but just then the third Parallel’s Red King (3) arrived and demanded to merge Red King (1). Red King (1) refused saying that he had changed his mind, but the other Red King (3) forced the merge regardless.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h3><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Downfall</span></span></h3> <p>Though he had stayed clear of the core reality, the Justice League indigenous to the Second Parallel realize its existence, the truth about their own being nothing but a facet in the Materioptikon, and the fact that the Second Parallel had to be destroyed to protect the core reality. However, to counter this, the Second Parallel Justice League retrieved their own Materioptikon from their reality's JLA's satellite trophy case; using the power of the stone, they sent their reality's Plastic Man over to other reality to communicate with their selves in there to do battle with that reality's Red King. This Plastic Man ended in the First Parallel, where he posed as a bomb similar to the one which destroyed the Earth in the Second Parallel. The Red King (3) was cornered into the JLA's base in the moon, where he was duped into believing the bomb would kill him if he could not defeat the entire Justice League in under a minute, with time to get away clear of the blast. With the Martian Manhunter manipulating his emotions, he had no escape, and was tricked by the First Parallel's League into a vortex to the core reality generated by the First Parallel's Materioptikon. That reality's Wonder Woman crushed the stone, destroying the final Parallel and sealing Profitt within the core reality's Materioptikon, where Destiny's dreamself, free to roam to his leisure, prepares to torture the Red King with his now omnipotent powers.</p> <p><a href=\"///\"></a></p> <h2><span>Powers and abilities</span></h2> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>According to JLA Classified #35 he has over 63 different metahuman abilities including electrokinesis and cryokinesis. </li> <li>Using Doctor Destiny's Materioptikon Darrin is able to create mathematically modeled parallel earths. He is able to generate a finite number of <i>Parallels</i>, parallel universes generated by the Materioptikon but based on his home reality. Profitt uses the parallels as elaborate mathematical models , testbeds to determine favorable outcomes for his plans. Since the Materioptikon's power comes from the absorbed dream energy of six billion humans, every use of this power diminishes the number of available Parallels that can be generated and maintained. </li> <li>As the Red King he also wears a suit of high tech armor which incorporates technology solutions gathered from dozens of parallels designed to defeat individual members of the Justice League. </li> <li>As Fallback he might have had powers, but was unable to use them as another Red King killed him before he could demonstrate them. </li> </ul>",

In this reality, Rogue was referred to as 'Carol,' indicating that the stolen psyche of the Avenger Carol Danvers was in control of Rogue's body in this reality, and had apparently learned to control Rogue's mutant power of memory, power, and consciousness-stealing enough to be able to touch other people.</p><p>Malefactor (Vincent Von Doom), the son of Doctor Doom, tried to take over the Battleworld, and return to Earth, in order to follow in his father's footsteps and conquer it. Sarah lead her fellow young heroes to stop Vincent, and along the way grabbed Mjolnir, proving her worthiness to wield the enchanted hammer.</p><p>As the older generation of heroes and reformed villains fought off the Doombots that Vincent had sent, the Hulk returned from his self-imposed exile to inform them that he had finally found a way home to Earth. He had a device that used the portal-opening ability of Mjolnir, but the elder heroes decided it was too dangerous to use. Sarah and the other teenaged heroes met up at the device that night, to test out the device, and prove it was not dangerous. The teenagers did not make it home, but instead found an Earth that was swarming with Sentinels.</p><p>After they easily dispatched one of the robots, Sarah insisted that they not give up and go home and that it was their \"duty to bring peace to this planet, or <i>die trying</i>,\" following the example of their heroic parents.</p><h2><span id=\"Powers_and_AbilitiesEdit\">Powers and Abilities</span></h2><p>The same as Steve Rogers but can lift over 50 tons.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Season 1</h2><p>Ando is introduced into the show as the skeptic friend of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47668\" href=\"/hiro-nakamura/4005-47668/\" slug=\"hiro-nakamura\">Hiro Nakamura</a>. He works at Yamagato Industries with Hiro, and when we first see him working, he is actually on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47671\" href=\"/niki-sanders/4005-47671/\" slug=\"niki-sanders\">Niki Sanders</a>'s strip website. When Hiro discovers his powers, Ando is completely skeptic, and doesn't believe Hiro has them.</p><p>Hiro continues to try and convince Ando that he has powers, but Ando still doesn't believe him. When the two go to a bar, Hiro tries to show Ando that he has powers by teleporting into the girls bathroom. Ando goes to get beer, and when he comes back, Hiro is being thrown out. Outside, the two argue, with Ando questioning why Hiro wants to be so different?</p><p>Ando is finally convinced that Hiro has powers when Hiro brings a comic book by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47670\" href=\"/isaac-mendez/4005-47670/\" slug=\"isaac-mendez\">Isaac Mendez</a> from the future, and Hiro saves a girl with them. He then agrees to go on a trip with Hiro to America, following the comic book. They hire a Nissan Versa and head for Las Vagas. The two spend time at a casino, where Ando tells Hiro to use his powers to get them money, which he does but they get thrown out of the hotel. After attending another poker game, the two argue and seperate, and Ando goes to see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47671\" href=\"/niki-sanders/4005-47671/\" slug=\"niki-sanders\">Niki Sanders</a>.</p><p>Ando later wanted to kill Sylar himself but failed and he was saved by Hiro Nakamura.He also took part at the Kirby Plaza showdown where the heroes faced the ultimate villain , <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\" href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" slug=\"sylar\">Sylar</a> but Hiro lost control of his power and was sent back to 1671 in the feudal Japan where he encountered his childhood hero, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49575\" href=\"/adam-monroe/4005-49575/\" slug=\"adam-monroe\">Takezo Kensei</a>.</p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Four months later, Ando was having a talk with Hiro's father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47672\" href=\"/kaito-nakamura/4005-47672/\" slug=\"kaito-nakamura\">Kaito Nakamura</a> when Kaito got a letter which tells that he will die. Ando eventually got letters from Hiro via the Kensei Sword which contained hidden messages.Later he was helped by Matt Parkman but with no luck to find Hiro.</p><p>After Hiro returned from the past few weeks later he went to face Adam Monroe who killed his father and was also Takezo Kensei four thousand years ago.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>When Hiro travels to the future, he sees himself and Future Ando confronting each other on the a stairway, with Ando demanding the one half of the formula that Hiro has acquired. When Hiro pulls out his sword and attacks, Future Ando blasts Hiro with a bolt of lightning, immobilizing him. Future Ando takes the formula, and moves on. After returning in the present,</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5750/556508-redflame1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-556508\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77777777777778\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5750/556508-redflame1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-556508\"><img alt=\"Villain Ando\" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5750/556508-redflame1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5750/556508-redflame1.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></a><figcaption>Villain Ando</figcaption></figure><p>Hiro began avoiding Ando so he can move on with what he saw in the future.Eventually the formula is put together and Ando injects himself with it so he can save Hiro who previously trapped in the past after Arthur Petrelli took his ability.Ando manifested the ability of supercharging and with Daphne's ability they could bring Hiro Nakamura back to the present.</p><p>Four weeks later Hiro began living 'through' Ando becuse he lost his ability of space-time manipulation and wanted to help someone.Ando compared their relationship as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson who are Batman and Robin.</p><p>They went to save baby Matt Parkman from the governements army and they succeded and with the baby's ability, Hiro got his power back but later manifested head aches,bleedings and eventually was diagnosted with brain tumor.</p><h2>Season 4</h2><p>Six weeks later Hiro Nakamura and Ando Masahashi started their own business called 'Dial a Hero' but they were no customers.After Hiro teleported accidentaly back to a carnival fourteen years he changed the past by 'stepping on the right butterflies' and thanks to him, Ando and Kimiko Nakamura fell in love and they decided to marry.</p><p>Hiro's brain tumor got worse and began talking nonsense until Hiro figured out that all of this is a hidden message. Arkham Asylum is actually a sanatorium and Dr.Watson whom Hiro was talking about is actually Mohinder Suresh and they broke him out and with Ando's ability, they 'healed' Hiro's brain but he fell in coma after that.Soon Hiro was operated and Ando went to see him and the two began talking.</p><h3>Close to You</h3><p>As part of their plan to save \"Watson\", a reluctant Ando checks Hiro into the mental hospital \"Watson\" is trapped in. Ando isn't allowed to follow Hiro through a set of doors, but Hiro finds \"Watson's\" room and points it out to Ando. Ando shocks a keypad, allowing him to bypass the lock and he realizes that he's there to rescue Mohinder Suresh when he looks into the room and sees Mohinder.</p><p>Ando later visits with Hiro and asks why Mohinder doesn't use his powers to get away and Hiro makes him realize its because Mohinder is drugged. Seeing an opportunity, Ando switches Mohinder's pills with aspirin when an orderly isn't looking, but accidentally swallows Mohinder's pills and ends up drugged. Hiro leaves him in a closet and is able to free Mohinder thanks to Ando's efforts with the pills, but when they returns to Ando, he is in an extremely drugged state and his hands are glowing with his power.</p><p>The two wheel him out in a wheelchair, but are caught by orderlies. Snapping out of his daze, Ando blasts a door out open, creating enough of a distraction for Mohinder to overpower the orderlies. The three try to escape through a swamp, but are chased by orderlies with dogs and Hiro can't teleport them to safety due to his condition. Mohinder, after getting an explanation from Ando, suggests that Ando use his power like electro-shock therapy to try to return Hiro to normal so he can teleport. Ando is reluctant as his future self killed Future Hiro with that power, but Mohinder convinces him as they're in Florida and his future self was in Japan. Ando shocks Hiro, successfully restoring him to normal. In the nick of time, Hiro teleports himself, Ando and Mohinder away, just as dogs and orderlies find where they were hiding. The teleport takes them to Noah Bennet's apartment where they interrupt him and Lauren Gilmore kissing and Hiro asks for their help.</p><h3>Pass/Fail</h3><p>In Noah's apartment, Ando notices that Hiro is not looking so well. When Mohinder leaves and Hiro collapses, Ando rushes him to the emergency room and informs the doctors that Hiro has a brain tumor. He then watches as they take his unconscious body.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Hiro's dream, Ando is summoned to be Hiro's lawyer. Ando comments that things do not look good and says that things will work out. Adam Monroe calls younger versions of Ando and Kimiko to the stand and the kids tell the court how Hiro changed time so that they fell in love. Older Ando argues that what Hiro did was good and that no one was hurt. Later, after Sylar has spoken, Ando calls Hiro to the stand and asks what he has to say about it. Hiro tells everyone that he tried to be a hero and make the world a better place but Kaitosentences him to death. Later, Ando is amongst those who encourage Hiro to fight for his life. In reality, having watched the operation on Hiro, Ando is overjoyed when his friend survives the surgery and the tumor is succesfully removed.</p><h3>Brave New World</h3><p>Ando is in Hiro's hospital room and is happy when Hiro wakes up. He asks Hiro if he has full control of his powers back now that the brain tumor is gone and Hiro tests them by rewinding time by a minute, proving that he does. Ando and Hiro are confused when Hiro receives a note from another patient and are shocked to discover that it is a now-old Charlie. Ando witnesses Hiro's reunion with Charlie, but is unhappy with Hiro's decision to go back in time and return Charlie to her own time after she's taken as Charlie clearly has had a good life. Ando receives a phone call from Noah Bennet telling him that the Carnival is in Central Park and he and Hiro need to get there right away. Ando approaches Hiro who is saddened as he has decided not to return Charlie to her own time and believes all of his missions are now over. Ando reminds him about Samuel and tells Hiro that the Carnival is in Central Park and that \"destiny calls\". Hiro agrees and after blowing Charlie a kiss goodbye, teleports himself and Ando to the Carnival as Charlie watches. At the Carnival, Hiro and Ando are approached by Noah, Claire and the carnies and Claire asks Hiro to teleport the carnies away. Hiro has the carnies all hold hands, but confides to Ando that he's not sure he can teleport everyone as there are dozens of carnies. Ando offers to supercharge Hiro's powers to give him the boost he needs and Hiro agrees. With Ando supercharging him, Hiro is able to teleport everyone away from the Carnival, rendering Samuel practically powerless without other specials to draw power from and allowing Peter to defeat him. Hiro and Ando later walk through the nearly empty Carnival and decide to go home before watching Claire reveal her powers to the world.</p><p><u><b>Powers</b></u></p><p>During the first two volumes, Ando is a normal human with no abilities. In the opening episode of the third season, \" The Second Coming\", Hiro Nakamura travels into the future and witnesses Ando using an ability described by the writers simply as \"red lightning\". In \" Dual\", Ando injects himself with the formula, revealing that the red lightning amplifies the abilities of others. He demonstrates this unintentionally by boosting the range of Matt Parkman's telepathy to cover all of New York City and increasing Daphne Millbrook's super speed to such an extent that she is able to break the spacetime barrier. In the episode \"Cold Snap \", Ando learns to use his power offensively, channeling his energy into powerful bolts from his hands after having contact with Baby Matt Parkman. As seen later in \"I Am Sylar\", Ando has managed to produce and control a major amount of energy as he attacks agents inside a van with a heavy blast without damaging Hiro or the van itself.</p><p>Ando obtained the ability to supercharge others' abilities, which manifests in the form of red energy resembling electricity. He used it to greatly amplify Matt's telepathy, allowing him to hear the thoughts of all New Yorkers, and Daphne's super speed, allowing her to run faster than light and travel backward in time (<i>Dual</i>). He is also able to use this to supercharge Hiro'sspace-time manipulation, allowing him to teleport dozens of people an unknown distance all at once. (<i>Brave New World</i>)</p><p>In the episode <i>Cold Snap</i>, it is shown that Ando can charge the red energy in the palm of his hand and expel it as a concussive blast outwards. The energy is shown to be strong enough to knock a man, fully geared, backwards several feet. It cannot be discharged quickly, however, as it seems Ando requires at least a small amount of time to build up power. However, as of <i>I Am Sylar</i>, Ando's use of this has increased: he is able to blast all of Danko's team in a van with one shot, knocking them out but not taking out Hiro at the same time.</p><p>Ando is later able to shock a keypad, causing it to act like the proper code had been put in and not short out and later blasts open a door with his ability to shoot energy blasts from his hands. Later, Ando, at Mohinder's suggestion, uses his power like electro-shock therapy in an attempt to restore Hiro's scrambled brains back to normal and it works, reversing the effects of what was done to Hiro.

She sees that Annie has all of her stuff set up and Annie explains that she thinks the two of them should be friends. When she learns that Claire got into the school with a GED, Annie offers to help her, as she does not believe Claire will excel on her own. Claire reluctantly accepts her help and later joins her in Professor Fenton<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Professor_Fenton\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s algebra class. Claire has a nightmare in which she is attacked by a DHS agent and awakens. She leaves and declares that the class is not for her.

After the interrogation, she is too shaken to stay in the dorm and decides to stay with Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>for the night. Upon her return to college the next day, Claire is questioned again, this time by Gretchen<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Gretchen\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who debates over whether or not Annie's suicide was actually a suicide or a murder and wonders why Annie would map out her whole life only to end it. Seeing that Claire is unsure, Gretchen meets her in the campus cafeteria with a pile of forensics textbooks and explains the \"jump, push, fall\" test that she had learned about from an episode of Crossing Jordan<i><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Crossing_Jordan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a></i>. Gretchen wants to recreate Annie's \"suicide\" with a dead body dummy, which later that night gives Claire the idea to recreate it herself, but with herself as the dead body in question. Relying on Gretchen's explanation, Claire hurls herself out of her dorm window and lands in the spot where Annie's body was, and comes to the conclusion that Annie had, in fact, committed suicide<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Suicide\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire puts herself back together and slides her ribcage back into place, only to discover that Gretchen had been watching. </p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h3><b><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Episode:Ink\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br/></a></b></h3> <p>Claire initially ignores Gretchen<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Gretchen\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who knocks on her door repeatedly in an attempt to talk. Later, Noah<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>comes by and invites Claire to lunch. When Claire goes to the bathroom to prepare, Gretchen corners her and asks if she's a vampire, an alien, or a government experiment. She follows Claire back to her dorm room and takes advantage of Noah's visit to get herself invited to lunch. At the lunch, Gretchen drops a variety of hints about Claire's powers and her secretive nature. When they have a moment alone, Noah offers to call in the Haitian<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>but Claire says she will handle it on her own. She invites Gretchen to ask her anything and reveals her power<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Regeneration\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Later, the two girls chat and Claire explains that her power makes her immune to the effects of alcohol. Noah calls to apologize. Claire gives a prepared speech about living on her own and father and daughter end the call on amiable terms.

She runs a mock interview for a lumber company but Noah fails miserably at that.

Gretchen doesn't think that Claire should do it but Claire says that she'll give it a try. She gets Gretchen to tag along by promising to be her best friend forever. The two of them go to a \"speed-dating\" test and Claire tries to talk about herself. She is confused when she learns that most people already know a lot about their past. They inform her that Gretchen told them everything. </p> <p>Later, when Claire and Gretchen return to the room, Claire notices that Gretchen is wearing her sweater. When Gretchen goes to the bathroom, a book falls from the shelf and attracts Claire's attention. She places it back on the shelf and notices that Gretchen has pages and pages of information about her on her computer. She goes through them and finds hundreds of articles, including some about murder-suicides. Gretchen returns and Claire quickly acts as if she never found anything. Later, at the sorority mixer, Claire is talking to another pledge named Kara Hayback<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kara_Hayback\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire notices a banner pole falling and hurls Kara and herself out of the way. She looks up and sees Gretchen near where the pole fell. They return to the room and Claire demands to know why Gretchen has all the stuff about her on the computer. Claire believes that Gretchen is stalking her and Gretchen admits that she is, but only a little bit. When Claire asks why, Gretchen kisses her. Claire is left shocked and before she can say anything, Rebecca and the other girls welcome them both to the sorority. </p> <p>Unbeknownst to Claire, Rebecca returns to the carnival<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sullivan_Bros._Carnival\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and reports to Samuel<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Samuel\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, saying that she has nearly finished alienating Claire as ordered. </p><a href=\"///\"></a> <h3><b><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Episode:Tabula_Rasa\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br/></a></b></h3> <p>Claire goes to see Noah<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and asks him about his job hunting.

Claire admits that the kiss wasn't bad but that she doesn't want to ruin their friendship or her normal life. Suddenly, masked figures burst into the room and attempt to kidnap the two girls. Claire fights back but Becky<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Becky\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>unmasks herself and explains that they are actually kidnapping the two girls for their initiation into Psi Alpha Chi<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Psi_Alpha_Chi\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire and Gretchen are placed in the back of a car and Gretchen comments that it is nice being so close to Claire. Claire admits that she does not really know how she feels about Gretchen's romantic feelings. The car stops and the girls leave Claire and Gretchen in a slaughterhouse with Olivia<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Olivia\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>and Ashley<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Ashley\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. They explain that it is a scavenger hunt and that the winners will miss out on Hell Week. </p> <p>Claire, Gretchen, Olivia and Ashley find a clue relating to the sorority's founding. Claire successfully gets the right answer and then makes sure that the supplies are divided evenly between the two teams. Olivia and Ashley leave and Claire and Gretchen start searching through the house on their own. Claire asks Gretchen how long she has known that she likes girls and Gretchen admits that she has had boyfriends as well. She sees Claire's reaction and suspects that Claire is a virgin, which Claire does not deny. As they are talking, Claire sees a shadow and then pushes Gretchen to the ground as a hook comes flying towards her. She begins to think that someone may be trying to kill Gretchen and talks about the many possibilities of who could be behind it. She tells Gretchen that there are others like her and talks about the possibility of the killer being telekinetic<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telekinetic\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Gretchen and Claire reunite with the other two girls but soon split up. While in the Prep Room, Gretchen is attacked by an invisible<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Invisible\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>assailant and Claire tries desperately to help.

Noah answers he would love to. </p> <p>While having a milkshake, Claire asks if Noah likes his job as a paper salesman, and Noah says that he likes it a lot. Claire is a little bit surprised and asks what Noah wanted to become on high school, and Noah says he wanted to teach English in high school, Shakespeare<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Shakespeare\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire is surprised and asks him what he knows about Shakespeare. Noah cites Shakespeare for her. She asks him if it's Romeo and Juliet, but he tells her that it is Midsummer Night Dreams. She tells him he should teach, that he should do what makes him happy. Noah tells her he doesn't think it's going to happen. The other cheerleaders call Claire and she leaves.  <br/> <br/>Gretchen and Clare are talking about the happens and Gretchen decides that it's better if she leaves althou it is revealed that it was Noah all along who was she after because HRG killed her father. <br/>Samuel meanwhile approaches Claire but unsucfesfull. <br/>Later Samuel reveales to Becky that they've pushed Claire in their direction.<br/></p>  Claire became stalked by carnival member Eli who has the ability to create copies of himself.It became clear that it was eventually Samuel's idea so he can spy on her weather she will betray them or not.Claire told Lydia she doesn't fel home in there and after Samuel showed Claire a camp full of flower she left to bury her father. <br/> <br/>After the funeral Peter and Claire were talking where Claire told Peter she once had a boyfriend named West and he eventually ended up studying there in New York City.Peter to calm himself down, tried to stop a robbery only to end up wounded pretty badly but thanks to Claire, Peter mimiced her ability and healed really fast.Claire told him that he won't be always there to help him. <br/> <br/>Same night in the rooftop Peter asked Claire to call West for him. <br/> <br/>Claire eventually returned to college where he was caught by Sylar.He told her that she might be able to help him and by kissing her he used his empathic ability to understand what is wrong with both of them.Claire eventually put a sharp pencil in Sylar's eye and ran off.Sylar quickly shapeshifted to Gretchen and understood his problem than left. <br/> <br/>After the long afternoon Claire met up with Gretchen and the two decided to get together and not worry about what the people will say. <br/> <br/>Gretchen and Claire arrived to Noah's house where Claire found Lauren and saw what his father is planning:an assault on the carnival. <br/> <br/>Claire that night went ot Lydia to ask for help but Samuel arrived and planned to send Claire away but she told him to surrender and with this there will be no blood.Eli was hired by Samuel to 'fulfill' Noah's roll in all of this and after a planned assault Noah and Claire was to blame so they were imprisoned by Samuel who now planned to create a brave new world without people who doesn't understood them. <br/> <br/>Claire eventually saw her fathers, Noah's dark past before the Company in the house of mirrors where Samuel ordered Demien to show Claire. <br/> <br/>Claire still after that stood by his father's side and went to the souvenir trailer to release him but they were buried forty feet under ground by Samuel himself.<br/> <p><br/><br/></p>   <p><br/><br/></p> <h2>Powers</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339619\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.618\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.8%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339619\"><img alt=\" Regeneration\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 500w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Regeneration\" src=\"http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 500w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 480w, http://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1339619-regeneration.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Regeneration</figcaption></figure> <p>Claire has the ability of spontaneous regeneration or cellular rapid regeneration, meaning she can heal from any injury.

    "deck": "Claude is the Invisible Man.  He was the former partner of Noah Bennet (HRG) with the Company.  He became a mentor to Peter Petrelli and helped him focus his abilities.",
    "description": "<p>Claude was a member of the Company for years, being trained by one of their premiere agents Ivan.<br/> <br/>In <span>1990</span>, Claude and his first partner, <span>Haram</span>, are in <span>Côte d'Azur harbor</span> to capture <span>Rollo Fusor</span>. On a bridge crossing the harbor, Claude tries to calm Haram down and reminds him to follow their plan. Claude <span>sneaks</span> on board <span>Rollo Fusor's yacht</span> while Haram negotiates with Rollo Fusor for the release of two people he believes are held hostage. Claude helps <span>Haram</span> out of a <span>Côte d'Azur harbor</span>, then detaches <span>Pizet</span>'s <span>dehydrated</span> arm from Haram's handcuffs. <span>The Company</span> tracks <span>Rollo Fusor</span> to <span>Paris, France</span>, and Claude and Haram go there to capture Fusor and his <span>accomplice</span>. Using binoculars, they spot Rollo Fusor, his accomplice, and what they think may be their <span>next victim</span>. Claude becomes <span>invisible</span>, and the two agents storm the <span>hotel</span> room where their targets are located, only to learn that Rollo Fusor and the Frenchman are both dead and <span>dehydrated</span>, and the lady <span>accomplice</span> is missing. Claude and Haram determine that the lady accomplice must have had the <span>power</span> all along, and that Fusor really worked for her. <br/><br/> </p><p>Claude follows <span>Haram</span> to the roof to pursue the lady <span>accomplice</span>. She spots them and they track her from roof to roof, down a ladder and into a <span>Paris park</span>. In the park, Claude tries to get Haram to work with him as a team, but they appear to lose her and can only find a couple kissing under the moonlight. Then, just when they think they've lost her for good, Haram finds her fresh tracks in the grass. However, she responds by tipping over a tree that knocks Haram over and pins Claude to the ground. The lady quickly grabs Haram by the throat before he can free his partner. <br/><br/></p> <p>Still at the <span>Paris park</span> and trapped under a fallen tree, Claude turns <span>invisible</span> and hits <span>Rollo Fusor's accomplice</span> with a stick, forcing her to release <span>Haram</span>. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Haram grabs her by the arms and forces her to self-<span>dehydrate</span> into a pile of dust. Having finished their mission, Claude convinces <span>Haram</span> to agree to continue as his partner for another six months when police arrive to the park. </p> <p>Later, Claude arrives at the entrance lobby of Primatech to turn in his report on <span>Fusor</span>'s case, when he is surprised to learn from the <span>secretary</span> that <span>Mr. Bennet</span>, Claude's trainee, has already been made his new partner. Claude rejects the idea, stating <span>Haram</span> gave his word to stay on for six months; Claude asks to speak to Haram, but the secretary insists it's impossible to speak with Haram because he's \"retired\". The secretary then holds the door open to <span>Thompson's office</span>, saying that <span>Thompson</span> is waiting to speak with Mr. Bennet and Claude. <br/><br/></p> <p>In 1991, Claude sits in on <span>Mr. Bennet</span>'s interview in <span>Thompson's office</span>. A clean-shaven Claude <span>appears</span> and is partnered with Noah to work for <span>the Company</span>. </p> <p>In 1992, Claude takes <span>Noah</span> on a \"<span>bag and tag</span>\" mission. He leaves him to guard the hallway and enters <span>the apartment</span>, he turns <span>invisible</span> to avoid detection. Shortly after he enters there is an <span>explosion</span> inside the apartment. When Noah enters he finds Claude on the ground and his clothes are on fire. Claude tells Noah that <span>their target</span> has blown up and to get the <span>baby</span> from the next room. Claude and Noahescape the <span>fire</span> with the baby. Mr. Bennet asks if Claude can change a diaper. Claude says he can't, but that he could use a change of underpants for himself. <br/>on the <span>rooftop of the Deveaux building</span>, Claude and Mr. Bennet discuss what will happen to baby <span>Claire</span>. Claude waits with <span>Thompson</span> while Noah and <span>Mr. Nakamura</span> have a conversation. After Mr. Nakamura and his <span>son</span> leave Claude wishes Mr. Bennet a Happy Father's day in Japanese. </p> <p>In 1999, Mr. Bennet and Claude drive together, and Claude asks about their next assignment. Noah tells him they are \"looking into a security breach\"—Claude himself is the security breach. Claude laughs this off, and Noah asks him if he's hiding <span>one of them</span>. Claude claims he is, and the <span>vivisections</span> are starting to keep him up at night, and that Claire is \"one of us\". Claude confesses he was in Noah's office when he was being told to kill him, but thinks he is a better man than that. Claude gets out of the car, and stands on the side of <span>the bridge</span>. <br/><br/>He tells Mr. Bennet that he knows its not the first time he's been told to kill a man, but wants to know if its the first time he might have to kill a friend. Mr. Bennet levels a <span>gun</span> at him, claiming if Claude tells him who he is hiding, \"we can forget about the rest\". Claude says he will not hunt his own people, and asks Mr. Bennet what he would do if it was <span>Claire</span> he was hiding. Claude tells Mr. Bennet that he has a choice. Mr. Bennet shoots Claude twice, and as Claude turns <span>invisible</span> and falls off the bridge, Bennet shoots him again. <br/><br/>Later, while walking down a <span>New York City</span> street, Peter sees the Claude nonchalantly picking through the property of others. Peter follows him and yells to him. Claude is shocked to be seen; he grabs Peter and the two tussle. <span>Peter</span> quickly informs Claude that he can \"<span>do what you can do</span>,\" and Claude promptly wants nothing to do with Peter. He <span>disappears</span> around the corner, and Peter fades back into sight. He then follows Claude to the <span>rooftop</span> of <span>Charles Deveaux</span>'s <span>building</span>, where the two fight a bit more and Claude threatens Peter for following him again. Later, when Peter is running away from <span>his brother</span> and <span>Mohinder</span>, Claude shows up outside of <span>Peter's apartment</span> and helps him escape. The two then talk about Peter's <span>power</span> as an empath, and they go off to steal a cab. <br/><br/>Claude continues to work with <span>Peter</span>, trying to teach him to use his <span>power</span> consciously and not just as a reflex. Claude <span>takes a purse</span> from <span>a woman</span> standing nearby and hands it to Peter. He leaves Peter to see if he can maintain his <span>invisibility</span> without Claude's help, but Peter fails his test. Claude, realizing that Peter is too attached to people, tells him that people are selfish, deceitful and gassy. Peter insists that at least Simone is different. To find out whether or not this is true, Claude and Peter follow <span>Simone</span> to the <span>roof</span> of her father's building. <br/><br/>Claude uses Simone's intimacy with <span>Isaac</span> to taunt Peter, and they argue. Claude insists Peter <span>flies</span>, and he pushes Peter off the roof, causing him to crash into a taxi and impaling his chest on a piece of metal. However, he is saved by his absorbed power of regeneration. Claude tells Peter that he freed his mind and called out his power, but Peter believes that it was his recollection of Claire that brought out his powers. Unfortunately, he begins to overload, so Claude promptly punches Peter, knocking him out.</p> <p>On <span>Charles Deveaux's rooftop</span>, Claude attacks <span>Peter</span> with a pole; Peter eventually stops the blows, using <span>telekinesis</span>. Claude asks Peter which of his friends is telekinetic, and Peter realizes it's <span>Sylar</span>. Claude tells Peter that they may have a chance at stopping him from <span>exploding</span>, then strikes him in the face with another pole and knocks him down. </p> <p>As Peter and Claude discuss <span>evolution</span>, <span>Noah</span> and <span>the Haitian</span> detect their <span>invisibility</span> with <span>infrared goggles</span>. Claude is struck by <span>taser</span> darts and collapses. Peter throws Claude off of the building before jumping after him and <span>flying</span> them both to safety. Claude awakens in <span>Peter's apartment</span>. He shows Peter <span>the mark</span> on his neck, explaining that he's been hiding from <span>Mr. Bennet</span>'s <span>organization</span> for years, and vanishes.<br/><br/><span>Elle</span> tracks Claude through <span>London</span>, seeking to obtain control of her ability. As she's waiting for the right time to approach him, he aggressively asks her why she's following him. When Elle asks for help, Claude, still believing Elle to have ties with <span>the Company</span>, runs off before she can explain that she's no longer with them. The rain allows Elle to chase him, but she loses control of <span>her power</span> The water on the ground conducts and intensifies the electricity, and both Claude and Elle are rendered unconscious.</p> <p>Claude awakens in Trafalgar Square and <span>Lee</span> and <span>Abigail</span> help him up, Claude tells them to bring <span>Elle</span> along as well. Claude talks to Elle about <span>her ability</span> and agrees to help her control it. The two go to a showing of <em>Hamlet</em> at the <span>Globe Theatre</span>. There, Claude tells Elle to forgive <span>her father</span>. </p> <p>After Elle accidentally uses her power and electrifies Abigail and Lee, she decides to leave. Claude tries to get her to stay, but to no avail.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As the Haitian erases <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47673\" href=\"/matt-parkman/4005-47673/\" slug=\"matt-parkman\">  Matt Parkman's</a> memory, he begins thinking of what it feels like to have memories erased. He is reminded of his father, Guillame, back in his home village in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55946\" href=\"/haiti/4020-55946/\" slug=\"haiti\"> Haiti</a>. Guillame is revered by his people for the protection he provides and the love he shares. The villagers believe Guillame is special, and has unique powers. When the Tonton Macoutes are sent by Duvalier to terrorize the village, Guillame keeps the evildoers at bay. He uses his gift of \"bliss and horror,\" causing the militiamen to vomit and be overcome. Guillame is shocked when his power is suddenly disabled. He wonders what his son has done to him. </p><p>The Tonton Macoutes tie up Guillame in his village, and nobody cuts him down for twenty-four hours. Guillame decides to offer a sacrifice to the Loa to win back favor with his people. He insists that his son not be present. Instead, the boy sacrifices a pig in order to help give his father strength. Guillame confronts his people, uses his power on them, and makes them feel wonderful. Unbeknown to the Houngan, his son watches from beneath some bushes, filled with pride in his father. Suddenly, Guillame's power weakens, and his people see through him. Guillame grabs his son and beats him. When the young Haitian's prayers for death go unanswered, his power manifests uncontrollably, \"leaping from him like machetes\" and reducing the villagers to a zombie-like state.The Haitian and his father trek through the jungle, talking about what happened to their people. The Haitian believes something inside him lashed out and scraped their minds like fingernails. Guillame says that they are both cursed and must make amends. </p><p>They arrive at the crossroads. Guillame tells his son that they must rest until dawn. The Haitian asks his father if he hates them, which prompts Guillame to tell the story of the serpent and the crane. The serpent thought the crane was unworthy of his wings, so one day, the serpent swallowed the crane whole, and all of a sudden sprouted wings. The serpent was ecstatic, flying everywhere from the sun to the moon. The Haitian thought it was a good thing that the serpent got what he wanted, but Guillame retorts, \"What good is it to fly, if you have nowhere to go?\" . Guillame says he is able to drive men to ecstasy and horror when the Loa mount him. </p><p>He is able to lead nations, but he instead chooses to make the men euphoric and sleep with their women. That night, The Haitian dreams of a snake with no teeth and a crane with a broken neck. When the sun rises, Guillame and The Haitian trek up to an opening in the mountain, surrounded by skulls and an axe. The Haitian questions what they are to do there, but Guillame ignores him and tells his son to take his machete. The Haitian asks what is going on, but his father, in a trance-like state, kicks his son away. Guillame compares himself to the serpent, saying how he was blessed with the powers of the Loa, but he forgot where he came from. His curse was his son, who took his powers away. Guillame then lunges toward his son in a terrible rage, screaming that he will fly again. </p><p>Guillame continues to viciously attack his son at the crossroads. Guillame tells the Haitian that he forgives him for what he is, and allows The Haitian to be free of the pain his father is about to give him. Guillame throws him from the cliff and the Haitian falls, bouncing off the rock wall and crashing into a cliff farther below. The Haitian decides that if his death would bring his father peace, then he would die for Guillame with pride. </p><p>However, the Haitian, longing to touch his father one last time before his demise, reaches out to do so and finds past memories in Guillame's mind. This allows Guillame to \"remember the ground\", and he gives his son a necklace with The Symbol on it. As the Haitian breaks down in tears, Guillame jumps from the cliff to his death. </p><p>Just before his plunge, Guillame leaves his son with one final task—-to give peace to his people and bury their shame. He walks through the village contemplating his mission as the villagers grab hold of him with blank stares. When he is about to begin, a man comes into view. He looks at the villagers in their zombie-like state and asks the Haitian if Guillame did this, and then if the boy did this. The man looks at the necklace, and asks, \"Are you special?\" In response, the Haitian draws a picture of a hand snatching grub worms from a person's head in the sand. The man tells him that he wants to help him, \"all of you\", if he will let him. The Haitian, never letting go of his father's last wish to remember where he came from, leaves the village in hand with the visitor who finally introduces himself as \"Mr. Thompson\". As the two walk away while a snake slithers across the ground.</p>",

Hiro meets \"flying man\" <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47677\" href=\"/nathan-petrelli/4005-47677/\" slug=\"nathan-petrelli\">Nathan Petrelli</a> at the diner. Nathan gives him a ride back to Las Vegas, in a car. This entire time Hiro tries to warn \"Mr. Issac\" that in five weeks he will be dead, as seen when he went to the future. One call, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47678\" href=\"/peter-petrelli/4005-47678/\" slug=\"peter-petrelli\">Peter Petrelli</a> picks up and tells Hiro the message, \"Save the Cheerleader, Save the World.\"</p><p>Reunited, Ando and Hiro go to the Burnt Toast Diner to wait for further instructions from Peter.

To save her, Hiro goes back in time, but all for naught. Returning to the present, Hiro thinking his quest to save the cheerleader has failed meets Issac. Issac paints Hiro battling a dinosaur, so Hiro vows to get the sword. Taking the painting as collateral, Hiro travels to trade the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48433\" href=\"/mr-linderman/4005-48433/\" slug=\"mr-linderman\">Linderman</a> group, an avid collector of Issac's paintings for the sword. Hiro's father attempts to stop Hiro, ripping the painting, but is soon persuaded to let Hiro go about his quest.

Hiro and Ando return to the Present and confront Sylar. Sylar breaks the sword and Hiro and Ando get it repaired. While Hiro trained with his Dad, Ando assuming Hiro would give up his quest, tries to confront Sylar again. Hiro saves Ando and returns him to Yamagato industries. Hiro then proceeds to confront Sylar at Kirby plaza stabing Sylar in the chest. Sylar flings Hiro at a building as a last effort and Hiro teleports finding himself in Kyoto, Japan in the year 1671.</p><h2>Season 2</h2><p>Hiro is in Kyoto, Japan in the year 1671. He sees the occurance of an eclipse and then is faced by arrows raining down upon him and another man under a symbol on a flag that matches <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49575\" href=\"/adam-monroe/4005-49575/\" slug=\"adam-monroe\">Takezo Kensei</a>'s sword. Hiro freezes time to save his hero from an untimely fate only to discover that it was a replacement sent there by the real Takezo Kensai, an englishman dressed as a samurai who had planned on using the decoy as a distraction to snipe his enemies from a tree with a crossbow. Yaeko, the one foretold to be Kensai's princess, is a swordsmith's daughter that repeals her father's payment of his sword. She then goes off to face the bandits herself. Wanting to fix the mistake of altering the past, Hiro donnes his heroe's armor and confronts the bandits in an effort to save Yaeko. Hiro then chases off the bandits by using his powers to collect all their weapons in the blink of an eye. Hiro had saved Yaeko and Kensai's reputation, and had sparked Yaeko's love for Kensei.</p><p>Hiro then returns to Kensei and sways him to be the Hero the ledgends had been written about. However, as the two leave Kensei is shot with arrows and killed. When Hiro removes the arromws Kensei shows his unknown ability to heal and regenerates to life. Hiro decided to test Kensei to see if he had truely become the hero of ledgend and forces him to fight 90 ronin to retrieve the \"fire scroll\". Succeeding, Kensei decides to become the hero that Hiro sees him to be. To this, Hiro decides to leave but falling in love with Yaeko himself and the desire to make sure the timeline is secured, makes Hiro stay.</p><p>The Trio of Kensei, Hiro, and Yaeko travel to the dreaded White Beard's camp to save Yaeko's father. However, once Yaeko is save Hiro, weakened by his love, Admits to loving Yaeko and the two kiss much to the pain of the secretly onlooking Kensei. Kensei grows angry and joins White Beard and captures Hiro, Yaeko, and her father.</p><p>Hiro, captured in White Beard's camp and drugged on opium to prevent him from using his powers, is freed by Yaeko who had freed herself from her own bindings. Hiro is able to focus long enough to free Yaeko and her father. That night Hiro goes preform the next to last trial of Kensei, to save all of Japan, destroying White Beard's guns. Hiro goes to light the gunpowder cache, but is stopped by Kensei. During the battle Hiro tries to persuade Kensei to change ways and be the hero he was supposed to be. However, Kensei vows that as long as he lives he will destroy everything he holds dear. During the battle, a lamp is knocked over and before it explodes Hiro teleports away.</p><p>Hiro returns to Yaeko. Hiro is upset and tells the end of Kensei's story to her. She then tells Hiro that as long as she lives she'll tell the story of the real Takezo Kensei, Hiro. So,, like Kensei, Hiro \"cuts out his heart\", and returns to his time.</p><p>Back in his own time, Hiro discovers his father has been killed. Hiro attempts to save his father but is persuaded that he cannot play god with his powers and must let his father die. Hiro, however, uses his ability to discover his father's murderer, only to discover that it was Kensei.</p><p>Hiro begins his quest to stop Kensei. Discovering Kensei's real name, Adam Monroe, Hiro travels back to 1977, where he sees his father imprison Adam for almost releasing a deadly virus. Hiro learns that this virus will be contained in the Primatech facility in Odessa, Texas. Hiro goes to the facility via teleportation and stops time. He searches for Adam only to find Peter Petrelli. Hiro explains to Peter why he is here and what Adam plans to do, but Peter is blinded by the fact that Adam healed his brother after Peter exploded. The two battle but Hiro is knocked out.</p><p>Hiro is awoken and joined by Nathan Petrelli and Matt Parkman who are also trying to stop the releasment of the virus. Hiro teleports to Adam and Hiro tells him that he should not of let him live long ago. Grabbing Adam's arm the two disappear. Hiro puts his once hero, Adam Monroe in a casket and buries it in a Japanese graveyard.Hiro later tells Ando that Adam will not hurt anyone ever again.</p><h2>Season 3</h2><p>In season 3, Hiro owns 50% of Yamagato Industries and he tells Ando that he is not interested in money and he wants adventure. Hiro claims that it's not his destiny to be in the company. Shortly after that conversation, the family lawyer gives Hiro a document, inside it was a tape and it told Hiro to play it. Hiro plays it and in the tape was his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47672\" href=\"/kaito-nakamura/4005-47672/\" slug=\"kaito-nakamura\">Kaito Nakamura</a>. Kaito tells Hiro that there is a family secret insde a safe and Kaito told Hiro to keep it in the safe and never take it out. Kaito tells Hiro that it is his destiny. After watching the tape, Hiro is not happy, he says that he doesn't want to be a sentinel and protect the secret. Hiro then finds a button and it opens up the safe, Hiro thinks that whatever's in that safe, it's his and Ando's destiny.</p><p>Inside the safe was a note saying \"Press play\". When Hiro pressed play, Kaito was on it and was angry at Hiro. He then tells him that inside that safe is a very important formula and that if it falls into the wrong hands, it could destroy the world. Kaito tells Hiro to do whatever it takes to protect it. Just when Hiro takes the formula out, a super fast thing whooshes its way and takes the formula. Hiro quickly stops time but the person was so fast that she could even move when Hiro stops time. She knocks Hiro out and runs off at super-speed. Later that night, Hiro teleports into the future to see what happens if he doesn't get the formula back, in the future he sees Ando killing the future him with some sort of red electricity ability. After seeing that the whole world splits up, after seeing that future, Hiro is detemined to get the formula back. Hiro then hires private detectives to trace down the theif, the theif was revealed to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57501\" href=\"/daphne-millbrook/4005-57501/\" slug=\"daphne-millbrook\">Daphne Millbrook</a>. Hiro and Ando teleports to her apartment in Paris and they find a lot of stolen goods but not the formula. Hiro reveals to Ando what he saw in the future and Hiro starts to get a bit paranoid around Ando. Hiro comes up with a plan to get the formula back but it failed. Hiro reveals to Ando that he has put a tracking device on Daphne, Ando asks why didnt he tell him and Hiro tells him that he doesn't trust him. Ando then starts to get a bit annoyed.</p><p>The tracking device tells Hiro and Ando that Daphne is in Berlin, Hiro finds Daphne and asks her why she's here, she tells Hiro that the other half of the formula will be exchanged and she's waiting to intercept. Hiro tells her that the world would end if he doesn't have the formula back but Daphne tells him that she's only doing it for the money. Daphne tries to run but she couldn't run at superspeed, Hiro then tries to teleport but he couldn't do it as well. Hiro then recognises the Haitian and he realises that his abilities' blocked by him. Hiro then tries to get the formula without his ability but fails, Daphne grabs the other half and he and Ando gets captured by the Company.</p><p>Angela then tells Hiro that he has the key to stop the person manipulating them. Hiro and Ando then digs up Adam Monroe believing that he knows who is manipulating them but they shortly loses Adam when he gets captured by the Pinehearst company. Hiro thinks that he needs to be a \"Badass\" and he joins the Pinehearst company. Knox tells Hiro to kill Ando to proof he's a badass and he uses a fake sword and fake blood to do that. Both Daphne and Knox believes that Hiro has killed Ando and Knox lets him join Pinehearst. Hiro was given his first assignment by Daphne, the assignment was to recruit a future painting man in Africa. Daphne warns him to be careful and Hiro ignores the warnings. Hiro goes to Africa and searches for \"Mr. Africa Issac\" Hiro tries using his powers but he fails both times. When Hiro doesn't use his powers the future painting bushman tells him that it was all a test and that he is ready to take him to the villains he seeks.</p><p>Ando persuades Hiro to go back in time so that he knows how to stop the villains but Hiro refuses fearing that he might create another villain like Adam Monroe. Usutu then tells Hiro that he must choose his own path or have it chosen for him. Usutu then gives Hiro some paste telling him that it is a ancient family recipe. Hiro eats it and shortly afterwards, his eyes turn white and he falls unconcious but his white eyes was kept open. While Hiro was unconcious, he see's into the past and finds out what Arthur Petrelli had done in the past and that he was still alive, he also finds out that one of the villians, Flint, is related to Claires biological mom Meredith. Hiro wakes up and wants to warn the Petrelli's and Meredith but before he can he hears a scream, him and Ando search and find out that Usutu's been decapitated, suddenly Arthur apears and grabs Hiro's head and Hiro starts screaming. Ando tries to attack Arthur but is telekineticly thrown aside, Arthur then gets distracted by a painting of an eclipse and takes his hands off Hiro to look at it. While he's distracted Arthur tells Hiro to teleport, although Hiro doesn't understand he eventually teleport when he see's Arthur coming back. They end up in a bowling alley in Tokyo, Hiro gets happy because they serve waffles, after talking to Hiro, Ando finds out that Arthur erased Hiro's memory and now Hiro's believes he's 10. Ando tries to convince Hiro that he's an adult and has superpowers, at first he's skeptical but Hiro soon believes after he starts using his powers to prank people. After Hiro gets the hang of his powers Ando tells him they need to teleport somewhere to help his memory, Hiro then teleports to a comic book store, which he calls the source of all knowledge. After looking through a couple of marvel books and be shocked at some of marvels current events, Hiro see's a issue of 9th Wonder with him on the cover, Hiro see's the comic which, shows Hiro and Ando reading that comic, Hiro is still skeptical but Ando convinces him. They then go to the end of the comic to see what happens, but all thats there is the eclipes that says \"it coming\".</p><p>Hiro and Ando then travel to Matt's apartment according to 9th Wonders, there, they find Daphne and Ando tells Matt that she can't be trusted, later, Daphne feels guilty and runs back to her old home. Ando then tells Matt that Hiro has lost his memory and needs him to help him regain it. Hiro then continues to behave like a 10 year old and Matt tells him that he is also looking for Hiro, Matt tells him all about the catalyst and what Arthur has been doing and Matt tells them that they can't save the world without Daphne so Hiro teleports Ando and Matt to a corn field and just when they teleported there, the eclipse started to form and Hiro and Matt loses their abilities. Matt tries to get into Daphne's house but couldn't without his ability. After the failure, they return to the corn field and tries to figure out what's happening. Hiro then starts throwing corn at Matt and tells him not to rely to much on his ability and trust in himself . Hiro and Ando then leaves Matt to continue persuade Daphne. Hiro and Ando continue to find out what to do but they realized that they reached the end of the comic. Hiro and Ando travels to a comic book store and asks for the newest issue of 9th Wonders.</p><p>Upon entering the comic shop, Hiro is met by two ninth wonders fans, the comic shop owners. Hiro begins to flip through comics but when told that \"this isys all the ninth wonders and begins reading of his adventures. After an unknown amount of time, Hiro runs to another room claiming he never wants to grow up. On investigation this revelation is from reading everything he has done in the past few seasons, such as stabbing Sylar, attacking Adam Monroe, and his fathers death. The shop owner after a very Hiro-like speech of ones responsibilities and such, Hiro leaves the room. This is when the other store owner brings up the fact that Hiro and Claire have only been in one panel together, Kirby Plaza, but that \"doesn't count because they shared no dialogue.\" However the second employee points out he found Claire and Hiro watching in the background as Hiro's father gives Noah Claire. Deducing that doing this would restore Hiro's memory, Hiro goes to Claire.</p><p>Hiro arrives just in time as Sylar is about to kill Noah in the Bennet house. He then teleports Sylar away as he calls him \"bad man\". THis is then followed by Hiro reappearing and making Elle disappear. Once this is done, He once agian appears and says \"Save the Cheerleader...\" and teleports through space and time with Claire. In the past Claire and Hio watch as Claire is given to Mr. Bennet. When Mr. Bennet leaves Claire follows while Hiro watches his mom. His mom he discovers has the ability to heal and when he is alone he goes to her and laments that he has lost his memory and that he needs to be healed. His mother does so and Hiro has a moment with his mother. He then asks for a \"light\" that was mentioned between his mother and father earlier which must be the catalyst. After giving Hiro the catalyst, his mother promptly dies. That night Hiro meets Claire and he tells her that he has gained the catalyist and they can go. Before they get to though, Arthur Petrelli appears and takes Hiro's power and the catalyst and tosses him off the building. He teleports Claire to the future telling her that she should tell Angela she loses. Arthur then returns to the future himself. A yell is heard then and it is Hiro, hanging from a flagpole calling for help. In the present during this Daphne, Matt, and Ando recover Issac Mendez's sketchbook telling of the last ninth wonders tale. In it it tells of Hiro's venture into the past and his perdicament of being stranded in time. It is decided among the group that if the catalyst worked, a new time traveler could appear to help Hiro and Ando claims that it should be him.</p><p>Two months later, Hiro tries to get Ando to embrace a life as a super hero. He is quickly captured by the American government and becomes a fugitive. After seeing a precognitive painting made by Matt, Hiro and Ando travel to India , where Hiro learns that he does not need powers to be a hero. The two friends are contacted by Rebel , who gives them the mission to save Matt Parkman. Hiro and Ando soon discover that the Matt they have to save is in fact Matt Parkman Jr. , the infant child of Matt Parkman Sr. During an attack from the government, baby Matt partially restores Hiro's powers.</p><p>Hiro and Ando rescue the baby from being captured by agents and begin a cross country journey to return him to his father. After doing so, Hiro and Ando team up to bring down Building 26 . Before doing so, the friends discover that stopping time has several ill effects on Hiro's health. The two of them try to overcome this and manage to free all of the prisoners within the building. Working together, they capture all of the agents and successfully sedate Danko . While at the funeral of \"Sylar\" , Hiro confesses to Ando that he is not ok and needs help with his powers.</p><p>After the fall of Building 26, Hiro and Ando are searching for guidance. They go to Claire and meet Rachel Mills . Together, Hiro, Ando and Rachel help Claire save Alethea Throm and Magdalena Muller , making Hiro discover that helping people with his powers is his new path.</p><h2>Season 4</h2><p>Hiro and Ando , having returned to Japan , are now running a special Dial a Hero phone service. Hiro claims that the idea will work and Ando finds a photo of a younger Hiro, Ando and Kimiko at a carnival . Hiro remembers the night but the two of them are interrupted by Kimiko, who is furious about how much money is being wasted on Dial a Hero. Hiro tells her not to worry and she leaves angrily. Ando then comments that maybe Kimiko is right but the phone rings and they receive their first call for help. During the mission, Ando falls from a roof and Hiro stops time to save him. After returning time to normal, Hiro is suddenly frozen in time himself. Ando takes him back to Yamagato and Hiro returns to normal, saying that he is dying. He then accidentally time travels back to the night of the carnival.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samuel is seeking a replacement space-time manipulator for his traveling circus troupe and uses his ability to discover and track down Hiro. Arnold then transports Samuel fourteen years into the past at the same Carnival a young Hiro, Ando, and sister are attending.</p><p>Hiro meets Samuel who reveals that he is quite interested in Hiro's ability , while Hiro is very fearful of altering the past due to butterfly effects and the previous catastrophes he believes are a direct result of his actions. Samuel convinces Hiro that the unique ability to right his past wrongs can be done without disrupting the space-time continuum by throwing a ball at a stacked milk jug unevenly without the stack falling.</p><p>Hiro then begins his mission of fixing his past and the lives of his loved ones by preventing the catalyst of his sister's dislike of Ando. Upon returning to the present, he discovers that they are in love and have been dating for years, despite his incomplete control over his restored time travel ability.</p><p>Hiro speaks with Kimiko , who tells him that she and Ando are getting married and that she would like him to give her away. Hiro says that he will and goes to speak with Ando, who is worried that Hiro may not be alive to attend the wedding. Hiro tells him that he will be fine and there is a call on the Dial a Hero line. A man named Tadahasi tells Hiro that he is going to jump from the Yamagato building and Hiro rushes to the roof. He recognises Tadashi, who tells him that he was fired for inappropriate behaviour at the New Years Eve party. The man jumps before Hiro can save him.</p><p>Hiro time-travels back a few minutes and rushes to save Tadashi. Tadashi once again jumps and Hiro once again goes back to try and save him. After 46 failed attempts at saving Tadashi, Hiro tries a different approach and sits down and talks with him. He tells Tadashi that he should find a different job if he is unhappy and Tadashi thanks him. Hiro then speaks with Kimiko and tells her the truth about his condition. Kimiko hugs him and as Ando enters the room, Hiro is gripped by one of his migranes and then disappears having teleported away.</p><p>Hiro's unexpected Teleportation from Yamagato takes him to Peter Petrelli 's appartment. Though both are surprised to see each other Hiro is excited to see Peter, until he suddenly passes out and Peter catches him.</p><p>Hiro awakens and finds himself in a hospital bed. Peter tells him that he is dying and Hiro tells him that he already knows, and that he believes he teleported to Peter to help with something. Peter tells him that he is going to help Hiro and replicated his ability. Soon after, Hiro receives a visit from Emma , who asks him how they can live with their powers. Hiro tells her that those with abilities must answer their call to destiny but Emma refuses to do that. Hiro finds her in her office and she tells him about her ability to see sound and Hiro explains about his ability. Emma claims that she wants her power gone but Hiro insists that she cannot do that and that she must embrace her powers.</p><p>Hiro performs in a talent show, acting as the \"Amazing Hiro\". He spots Emma and calls her his assistant and touches her shoulder, freezing time. He explains that their abilities make them special and that there are no bad powers. Emma realizes the beauty of her ability and helps Hiro with his act. Hiro returns to bed and Emma tells him that he must not use his power anymore, or else he will die. Hiro tells Emma about Charlie and then realizes that she is not on his list. He puts her down and Emma tells him to rest. Hiro soon hears Emma's music and goes to investigate. He listens happily and Emma spots him. She escorts him back to his room but before he gets there he suddenly teleports away.</p><p>Hiro appears in Texas , three years ago. He turns to look in the window and smiles, saying \"Charlie\".</p><p>Hiro accidentally teleports back to the day of Charlie's death and steals clothes from a nearby clothes line as all he's wearing is his hospital gown. After explaining his mission to a boy who catches him, Hiro and Petey head for the Burnt Toast Dinner where Petey gives Hiro his white sheriff's hat, saying \"good guys wear white hats, bad guys wear black hats\", right before Sylar shows up wearing a black hat. Hiro protects Petey, but Sylar simply asks him to move out of the way so he can enter the diner, which Hiro does.</p><p>In the diner, Hiro hides behind a newspaper and observes Sylar's interaction with Charlie. He watches Sylar decets Charlie's blood clot and claim he can fix it. Hiro is interrupted in his watching by Samuel , who warns him that changing things here could drastically alter the future as this is such a pivotal moment for many people. He asks Hiro if saving Charlie is absolutely worth it, and Hiro says that this is the biggest butterfly he has to squash. Hiro, realizing what's about to happen, freezes time and stops Sylar from killing Charlie. Hiro wheels Sylar out to a bus to Odessa on a dolly and traps him in a bus compartment before returning to the diner. At the diner, Hiro realizes that he isn't in Charlie's birthday photo and remembering what Samuel said, heads into the bathroom where he encounters his past self. Hiro introduces himself as Future Hiro and tells his past self that Charlie is dead and his mission now is to \"save the waitress\" and that the cheerleader will be fine. Hiro convinces his past self who teleports six months into the past and Hiro calls him a moron. Hiro is back in the photo of Charlie's birthday party and after being reminded by Samuel, Hiro tells Past Ando what Past Hiro has done and convinces him to stay and wait for Past Hiro at the diner.</p><p>Hiro then visits Charlie who remembers him and is glad to see him. Hiro offers to take her on the world trip she wanted and she agrees and decides to go to Otsu, but her blood clot starts to turn into a fatal anyuerism that will shortly kill her. Hiro, not wanting this and remembering what Sylar said about being able to fix it, travels to the Odessa Bus Station via motor scooter as he still can't control his teleportation. There he finds Sylar missing and is pinned to a bus by him, but Hiro escapes by stopping time, which releases Sylar's hold on him. Hiro tries to make a deal with Sylar: save Charlie in exchange for information about Sylar's personal future, but Sylar keeps trying to get him with telekinesis. Hiro keeps stopping time and moving around, but it takes a toll on him and he develops a headache each time he does it. Sylar detects Hiro's brain tumor and is finally interested enough to agree to the deal and Hiro takes him back to the diner.</p><p>At the diner, Sylar uses his telekinesis to get rid of the blood clot while Hiro comforts Charlie. It works and the dissolved blood clot leaks out of Charlie's eye, saving her. Hiro keeps his end of the deal and tells Sylar that he becomes a killer with a lot of powers that a bunch of people teamed up to stop and he dies alone and that no one will miss him. Hiro then stops time and returns Sylar via motor scooter to the place where he made the deal with him.</p><p>Hiro returns to the diner, but Charlie is horrified about the deal he made with Sylar and the fact that he saved her out of the many people Sylar killed, but did nothing about them. Hiro tells her that it's because he loves her, but she says it's she had made peace with dying, calls him selfish, just runs off, and Hiro has to send a curious Past Ando back into the diner. Later, Hiro orders a root beer and converses with Noah Bennet about how complicated love is before Noah leaves and Charlie returns. Charlie and Hiro reconcile, but when Hiro follows Charlie outside, he finds her gone and Samuel Sullivan waiting for him. Samuel reveals he had Arnold take her forward in time to his carnival and if Hiro wants to see her again he has to take control of his power and teleport them back there. In anger, Hiro grabs Samuel and manages to teleport them both back to the present carnival.</p><p>At the carnival Samuel is happy as Hiro teleporting them back on purpose means that Hiro is regaining control over his power. Hiro demands to know where Charlie is, but Samuel says she's not exactly there and after seeing the carnies and Samuel look at a specific trailer, Hiro goes there, finding Charlie's name tag outside it. Inside he finds a dead Arnold, but no Charlie. Samuel explains that he had Arnold trap Charlie somewhere in time in order to gain a hold over Hiro and as the strain of doing that killed Arnold (he was dying of a brain tumor too), only Samuel knows where she is and he'll only tell Hiro if Hiro helps him fix his own mistakes. Hiro reluctantly agrees and Samuel tells him the first thing they need to fix is a mistake he made eight weeks before.</p><p>Hiro eventually went back in time and saved <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47676\" href=\"/mohinder-suresh/4005-47676/\" slug=\"mohinder-suresh\">Mohinder</a>'s life but inprisoned him into an asylum for eight weeks so he can be safe there while he gives back Samuel the tape he requested.</p><p>After <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67380\" href=\"/samuel-sullivan/4005-67380/\" slug=\"samuel-sullivan\">Samuel Sullivan</a> put his hand on it, had arranged the thanksgiving dinner where he confessed that Edgar was the one who killed Joseph Sullivan(which is not true) and turned on him along with the whole carnival.Before Samuel could kill Edgar, Hiro froze time and saved Edgar telling him that they will both have revenge on day.After Edgar sped away Hiro calmed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-68729\" href=\"/lydia/4005-68729/\" slug=\"lydia\">Lydia</a> that Edgar is safe.</p><p>Later that night, Samuel had Damien use his power to make Hiro renember things but due his brain tumor, Hiro teleported back to Japan and had a very strange reaction.First he taught he's in the Star Wars movies and used an axe as a lightsaber to save a woman who was being robbed.</p><p>After the police arrested him, they brought to Ando where they figured out that the 'danger room' Hiro was talking about was infact Hiro's 'sacred' place where he was keping his comic book collection.Hiro than claimed that they must go to Arkham Asylum to save someone from the stormtroopers.Ando did a quick research and realised that the asylum Hiro was talking about is in Florida at a street called Arkham and the patient they have to save is actually Mohinder Suresh himself.</p><p>Hiro was sent to the madhouse but it was a disguise so they can free Mohinder Suresh.Hiro and Ando escaped the facility and went hiding into the forest where Ando used his ability of red lightning to 'fix' Hiro and they teleported away just before the guards could have found them,but unfourtinatly they teleported to Noah Bennet's apartament.</p><p>Hiro eventually passed out due his brain tumor which got worse than ever and entered a hallucination where he saw Adam Monroe the prosecutor,Ando Masahashi his lawyer and his father, Kaito Nakamura as the judge. His was at a court in the Burnt Toast Dinner.</p><p>Adam acussed Hiro for using his power of bending space and time for his own personal gain.The first witnesses were a young Kimiko and Ando who confessed that a man stood up and let his suit get runed by the slushy at the carnival fourteen years ago.Adam realised that 'the man' was present-day Hiro himself so with this he changed the course of history and allowed Ando and Kimiko to fell in love.</p><p>The second witness was Sylar who told Adam that he made a deal with Hiro.If Sylar saved Charlie Andrews than he can kill whoever he want's.Kaito found Hiro guilty and the crime would be punishable by death.</p><p>Hiro entered a hallway where in the end was a big light.He told his father that if this is the end he want's to go out with pride and for that he had to face Adam Monroe himself. Adam and Hiro sword dueled and Hiro eventually won.After the duel Hiro's mother appeard and with her ability cured Hiro.</p><p>Hiro woke up in the hospital where he reunited with his friend Ando.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Hiro discovers he has the ability to actually affect the space-time continuum, slowing time down to such a point it seems as if it is stopped with sheer power of will. The first noted occurrence is when Hiro supposedly made a subway train late using this power. This is especially notable because a Japanese train being late at all is an extremely unlikely event. Later, he theorizes that he may soon be able to teleport by bending the space part of the continuum. Although this isn't seen, he does seem to teleport from the seating area of a Karaoke bar to a ladies' bathroom on a dare (said in jest) by Ando. While he is on a train he stares at a poster of New York, accidentally teleporting himself to Times Square. However, at the same time he unintentionally moves five weeks into the future. Later, when an explosion threatens his life, he is able to teleport back to Japan, landing at the exact time and place of his original departure.</p><p>Although being able to teleport and time travel great lengths at once, Hiro apparently had little control over how much time elapses when he teleports. This shows that, without further honing of his powers, he may not be able to teleport great distances without also traveling in time. He has also frozen time relative to himself. He was able to keep time frozen long enough to fold one thousand paper cranes. (Six Months Ago)</p><p>Hiro's rules of time travel haven't yet been explicitly defined. Whether he changes time just by traveling, or whether it's more of a ripple effect is not known. It should be noted that it appears Hiro's time-traveling powers may not supersede the principles of the self-consistency theory. This essentially states that a time traveler cannot alter history in such a way that he would cause a paradox to occur; rather, the events would self-correct. However, it seems Hiro's powers are controlled by \"fate\", as not only were his powers disabled at one point, but he traveled in both time and space against his will. This appears to be contradictory to Future Hiro's statement that he risked creating a \"rift\", as well as his existence being proof that he is trying to prevent the catastrophe. Hiro's ability was stolen by Arthur Petrelli in 1991, who had time traveled back from 2007 using the same power gained by his son. Arthur died after his return to 2007; leaving present-day Hiro trapped in the past before he was rescued by Ando and Daphne.</p><p>Hiro has regained his ability thanks to Matt Parkman Jr.'s ability. He used his restored time-stopping abilities to escape Danko's team as they were trying to capture him, Ando and the baby. During the escape, he tried to use the teleportation aspect of his ability, but could not. He later stated that he could not time travel. Hiro had also demonstrated that using his ability too much caused some kind of adverse effect. He had a terrible headache and his nose began to bleed after stopping time at least four times in less than five hours. Hiro also discovered the ability to keep others \"unfrozen\" with him by touching them as he freezes time. (I Am Sylar). Mohinder Suresh, after examining Hiro, said he thought that Hiro's body was rejecting his ability like a virus, and further use of it could be extremely dangerous. Hiro was diagnosed with a brain tumor that was causing him to die. He has since demonstrated the time travel and teleportation aspects of his ability accidentally (Orientation). He did not possess control over these restored parts of his ability, using them just on reflex (Orientation, Jump, Push, Fall). Hiro said that destiny is doing this and that time and space are now the master of him (Tabula Rasa). In addition to headaches and nosebleeds, Hiro also sometimes remained frozen in time while the rest of the world stays unfrozen. He also saw the past in this condition once, and then traveled there accidentally (Orientation).</p><p>After a lot of effort, Hiro was able to time travel and teleport at will, but couldn't control it completely. He was able to teleport to the carnival with Samuel in anger, but later needed a couple of tries to get back to the right time to save Mohinder: the first time he tried he landed ten minutes too late but got it right the second time. He also seemed to have displayed at will teleportation as he trapped Mohinder in a mental hospital in Florida (Once Upon a Time in Texas, Brother's Keeper). After having his brain scrambled by Damian, Hiro was incapable of willfully using his powers. Once his mind was fixed by Ando, Hiro was instantly able to teleport at will with no apparent problems, taking Ando and Mohinder Suresh with him to Noah Bennet's apartment. This was also the first time since regaining his ability that he has taken more than one person with him. (Close to You) After Hiro's brain tumor was removed, he regained full control over his powers and tested it out by rewinding time for himself by ten seconds. He is later able to teleport himself and Ando to the Carnival in Central Park with no problems or health issues. At the Carnival, Hiro is able to teleport all of the carnies an unknown distance despite there being dozens of them by having everyone hold hands with each other and Ando supercharging him at the same time, giving Hiro the boost he needed to teleport that many people.

But Mr. Bennet also has a non-work persona who lives and cares for his adopted daughter Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, his wife Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and his son <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Lyle\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> Lyle in their<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Bennets'_home_(Odessa)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> in Odessa,TX<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Odessa,_TX\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. He tries to protect his family from the dangers of his work using his partner, the Haitian<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, to erase their memories<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mental_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> when needed. <br/>Based out of the Primatech Paper CO<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech_Paper_Co.\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Mr. Bennet, the Haitian, and Eden <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Eden\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> carry out the capture<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bag_and_tag\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, evaluation, and release of people<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Evolved_humans\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> with special abilities<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Abilities\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. However, this work gets out of hand when two of the people, Matt Parkman<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Ted Sprague<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Ted_Sprague\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, invade Mr. Bennet's home, burn it down, and almost blow up <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Induced_radioactivity\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> the neighborhood. They expose his daughter's ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Regeneration\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and force him to send her on the run with his partner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Later, Mr. Bennet gets a new partner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Candice\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that exposes what he has done, and ends up on the run himself with Matt and Ted. Mr. Bennet decides they need to take out the Company's tracking system<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company's_tracking_systems\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> used for locating people <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Clairvoyance\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> with special abilities.

However, they learn that a threat known as Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is near. Mr. Bennet uses Molly to locate Peter Petrelli<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to fight Sylar. He tries to help Peter, but is hurt and is only able to be a witness. Mr. Bennet watches Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Fly\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> Peter into the atmosphere where the explosion<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Explosion\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> occurs.

Meanwhile, Noah has teamed with Mohinder<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to take down the Company from the inside. Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> picks up a newspaper one day and shows Noah an article about  Kaito Nakamura<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kaito_Nakamura\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s death. Noah tells her that he knew this would happen, and shows Sandra an old painting by Isaac Mendez depicting Kaito laying in a pool of blood. He tells her that it's part of a series of eight paints, but that he was only given the first one and needs to find the rest. the Haitian<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> joins Noah after being cured from a virus<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Shanti_virus\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> by Mohinder, and the partners seek out the paintings after Mohinder finds a painting of Noah lying dead. <p>Noah and the Haitian arrive in Odyessa,Ukraine<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Odessa,_Ukraine\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and find Ivan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Ivan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Noah's old mentor. Noah interrogates the old man to find the location of the paintings, then kills him. In a warehouse, Noah and the Haitian find the remaining six paintings by Isaac<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Isaac\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, placing them in order. The paintings depict several things, including a vial, an angry blond woman, two man <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hiro\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kensei\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> sword-fighting, Mohinder firing a gun, and Noah's death.

Noah then returns home to Costa Verde where he discovers Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is secretly dating West<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/West\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, even though Noah ordered her not to because it could jeopardize their safety. He then tells his family they're moving because of what Claire has done, but Claire refuses to go saying they should leave without her. <br/></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343309\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343309\"><img alt=\"   Noah being healed by claire's blood    \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg 400w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"   Noah being healed by claire's blood    \" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg 400w, http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56299/1343309-noah_being_healed_by_claire_s_blood.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>   Noah being healed by claire's blood    </figcaption></figure>     Attempting to avoid his own death as foretold in the painting, Noah goes to find West so they can save Claire. On the way, Noah learns of Mohinder's betrayal and plots to stop the Company. He and West go to meet with Mohinder, where they knock out and kidnap Elle<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Elle\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah learns that Claire has been kidnapped and calls Bob<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bob\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to arrange a trade. During the meeting, Bob releases Claire and Noah releases Elle, who walk by each other. West tries to fly Claire away, but Elle shoots them down with a lightning<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Lightning\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> bolt. Noah then shoots Elle and threatens to kill Bob, but Mohinder shoots Noah in the eye. Noah dies, but heals<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Regeneration\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and awakens on a hospital bed in an empty room with an IV of Claire's blood in his arm. <br/>While being held, Bennet tells Mohinder that he made a mistake by aiding the Company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Mohinder responds that he helped the Company save lives and stopped Noah's paranoia and violence. When Bennet is told that he was healed<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Rapid_cell_regeneration\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> with Claire's blood, he panics and demands to know where his daughter is. Mohinder dryly answers that Claire is safe at home. He is locked in a cell and sits idly bouncing a ball against a wall. Elle<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Elle\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> asks him to tell her about her past. He tells her about the testing her father arranged to see the extent of her ability. Later, Bob tells Noah that Claire is becoming a problem. Noah smiles, but when Bob says that it's unfortunate and that they may have to take drastic measures, the grin on his face disappears. Noah arrives at his home, shocking Claire and his family. He says that he didn't plan any of this but has found a way to protect all of them. He has to go back with the Company, much to everyone's dismay.   <br/><br/><h2>Villains </h2> <br/>  <b><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56062/1343317-hrg_and_sylar_as_partners_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56062/1343317-hrg_and_sylar_as_partners_thumb.jpg\"/></a></b>              Noah is released from Level 5<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Level_5\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> following the death of Bob Bishop<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bob_Bishop\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. He shoots Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and is knocked out after learning that he can regenerate<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Regenerate\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah briefly returns home to Costa Verde<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Costa_Verde\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, where he places Meredith<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Meredith\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> as his family's protector. Noah returns to Primatech<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to hunt down the villains but is less than pleased with his new partner, Sylar. Together, Noah and Sylar manage to bring in Flint Gordon<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Flint_Gordon\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> before they go after Stephen Canfield<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Stephen_Canfield\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is outraged that Noah is working with Sylar and even more outraged when Noah tries to get Stephen to make Sylar disappear<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Gravitational_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah and Sylar's partnership ends shortly after that. <p>Noah recruits Meredith to be his partner and together, they rescue the victims of Mohinder Suresh<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder_Suresh\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. After bringing in Danny Pine<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danny_Pine\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Noah takes Claire back to the Canfield house and begins to train her. During the eclipse<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Eclipse\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Claire is shot and is unable to heal. Noah uses this eclipse as a chance to hunt down Sylar. He finds him and Elle hiding in a supermarket storage area and manages to kill Sylar by slitting his throat. Noah returns home and is attacked by Elle<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Elle\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and the revived Sylar. Hiro Nakamura arrives<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hiro_Nakamura\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Space-time_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and saves the Bennet family from the two villains. Noah returns to Primatech where he, Angela<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Meredith and Claire prepare to take down Pinehearst. They are all stopped when Sylar shuts down the building and traps them inside. After releasing the remaining Level 5 detainees, Noah is trapped inside a cell with Meredith, who is losing control of her power<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Pyrokinesis\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire rescues Noah, who gets Angela out of the building safely after Claire kills Sylar.

Claire is furious with her father, who once again tries to live a double life to keep Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Lyle<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Lyle\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> in the dark. Sandra finds out what he is doing and the two of them break up, forcing Noah to move out. He is captured by Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Mat<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>t and Mohinder, who use Matt's unique interrogation skills<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to extract memories from him. Via this method, it is revealed that Noah only began working with Nathan to keep Claire from becoming a target. <br/>Noah returns to Building 26<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Building_26\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> after a meeting with Angela Petrelli and attempts to become one of the agents that Danko  trusts. Following Nathan's exposure<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Flight\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Noah offers to give Danko Rebel<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Rebel\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who has been helping people escape his clutches. Noah finds Tracy Strauss<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy_Strauss\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and offers her a deal to bring in Rebel. Unfortunately, Tracy dies<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Freezing\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Noah is forced to bring in a different target, Angela Petrelli. Noah does not bring in Angela and, after learning that Danko has killed Sylar, becomes obsessed with finding out if the killer is really dead. Noah is fooled by Sylar, who changes his appereance<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Shape_shifting\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> in order to make Noah seem like a killer. Noah becomes a fugitive and meets up with Peter, Nathan, Angela and Claire at the Coyote Sands<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Coyote_Sands\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. While there, Noah tells Claire the truth about why he joined Building 26. Angela reveals that she intends to start a new Company with them but the meeting is cut short when Alice Shaw<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Alice_Shaw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> creates a storm<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Weather_control\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that interferes with their plans. After their time at the sands ends, Noah and the others all agree that starting a new Company is a good idea. <br/>Noah is soon captured by Danko's team and placed in confinement with Danko<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> himself. The two of them agree to work together to stop Sylar once and for all and manage to escape following a mysterious<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Space-time_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> event within Building 26. Danko goes back on his word and is stopped by Hiro. Noah manages to find Peter and Claire and soon rejoins Angela and Matt, who have found Nathan's dead body. Thinking quickly, Noah and Angela get Matt to force Sylar into believing he is Nathan, finally \"killing\" Sylar once and for all. </p> <br/><h2>Redemption</h2> <br/> <p>Noah receives a phone call from Angela<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. She tells him of the recent deaths from Danko's team<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko's_team\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and theorizes that Tracy Strauss<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy_Strauss\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is behind them. Noah agrees and Angela gives him the assignment of killing Tracy before she gets to Noah or Nathan. Noah refuses and Angela tells him he has had six weeks to get his life in order. Noah admits he feels regret for what he did to Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and tells Angela that he is late for Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s first day at college. He gets into his car and starts it up. Water begins to flow into his car while the outside of it freezes<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Freezing\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, trapping him inside. Noah struggles for air as he begins to drown but is saved by Danko<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> who shoots in his windows. Danko suspects Tracy is to blame and proposes they team up to kill her. Noah refuses and Danko leaves. <br/>Noah proceeds to Claire's college where he meets and talks with her roommate, Annie<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Annie\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire arrives and Annie leaves. Claire talks with Noah about telling the truth and Noah supports her decisions. Noah then goes to a restaurant<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kojin_Sushi\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and is joined by Tracy, who tells him that he is number five. Noah attempts to change her mind and comments on how she survived. Tracy reveals that she felt herself shatter and reform and Noah tells her she is not a killer and he can make Danko forget about her. Tracy leaves, stating that it won't be that easy to get off her list. <br/>Keeping to his word, Noah leads Danko to a warehouse where he succumbs to the Haitian<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s memory manipulation touch<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mental_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>.  </p> <a href=\"///\"> </a>Returning home, Noah burns his supper and makes a call to Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. A man picks up the phone, shocking Noah until Sandra takes the phone. Noah hangs up and then receives a call from Tracy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. He meets her at Danko's apartment<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko's_apartment\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and discovers Danko<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s deceased body. Tracy protests her innocence at the crime and even describes his attacker<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Edgar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah realizes all the wounds are mainly to the stomach and reaches in, discovering a key hidden inside Danko's body. <br/> <p>Noah visits Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and comments on how he needs to call his mother<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Peter asks what Noah wants and Noah reveals to Peter that Danko was killed over a key to a safety deposit box which the killer will now be watching. He explains the attackers ebility to Peter and convinces him to tag along. They go to the bank where they receive the box. Inside they find a compass<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Compass\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Edgar enters the room, having injured a bank manager<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bank_manager\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and demands the compass before throwing a knife at Noah. Peter, having replicated Edgar;s ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Ability_replication\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, grabs the knife and fends Edgar off. After Edgar leaves, Peter helps the injured bank worker and has him taken to hospital<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mercy_Heights_Hospital\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. <br/>Noah and Peter discover that the compass moves when being held by Peter, but not by Noah. Peter refuses any more cooperation with Noah and leaves. <br/>Noah is then attacked and gravely injured by Edgar. Peter arrives on scene and has Noah sent to a hospital.

Gretchen<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Gretchen\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> takes advantage of his visit to get herself invited. At the lunch, Gretchen drops a variety of hints about Claire's powers and her secretive nature. Noah soon realizes that she knows something. When they have a moment alone, Noah talks to Claire and offers to call in the Haitian<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. However, Claire says she will handle the situation on her own. Later, Noah calls to apologize. Claire gives a prepared speech about living on her own and father and daughter end the call on amiable terms.   <a href=\"///\"> </a>Noah reads through his divorce papers, which he has received from Sandra<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sandra\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> arrives and attempts to show him a tattoo of the compass<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Compass\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> on his arm, but there is nothing there. Noah assumes that Peter imagined it, when Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> arrives. Peter leaves and Noah offers Claire some cereal. Claire offers to help him find a normal job but Noah insists that he doesn't have any experience in the \"real world\". Claire gives him a mock interview but he fails. <br/> <p>Noah tells Claire that there is no use trying to help him as his greatest strength is his loyalty to the Company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Claire tells him that he is a hero and reminds him that he has saved many people. Noah soon meets with Tracy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who is also having troubles returning to a normal life. Noah helps her out by giving her Claire's advice. Later, Noah studies several articles on the compass. Elsewhere, a tattoo of Noah appears<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Empathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> on Lydia<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Lydia\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s back and Samuel<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Samuel\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> wonders why he would appear. Lydia tells him that Noah is no longer retired.    <br/>Noah is visited by Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who asks how his job search is going. Noah answers but before they can talk about it they are interrupted by Peter<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who teleports<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Space-time_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> into the room, asking for help. He tells them that Hiro<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hiro\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is dying and that he needs a helaer to save him. Noah tells Claire that her blood<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Rapid_cell_regeneration\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> won't work and then goes through his old files, pulling out one about Jeremy Greer<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Jeremy_Greer\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Peter teleports the two of them to Jeremy's home and they find that everything around the house is dead. Noah speculates that, like another target in China, Jeremy's ability has evolved to the point where he can take away the life force of other living things. The two of them enter Jeremy's home and find his dead parents. They are then fired upon by Jeremy and Noah goes upstairs to talk to him. </p><p>Jeremy warns Noah to stay away from him and Noah learns that everything that Jeremy touches dies. Noah tells him that it is not his fault and that with enough practice, he will be able to heal people. Jeremy doesn't believe Noah but Noah insists that he has helped many people like him<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Evolved_humans\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Peter teleports between them and Jeremy's gun goes off, shooting Peter. Noah begs Jeremy to heal Peter and convinces the kid that he is a healer. Jeremy heals Peter and Noah sincerely thanks him before calling the authorities. He explains to Jeremy that he used to have a job helping people like him and that he has let him down. He promises that that won't happen again. </p> <a href=\"///\"></a> <p>Noah watches sadly as Jeremy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Jeremy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is placed in a holding cell. He speaks to Sheriff Werner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sheriff_Werner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who refuses to release Jeremy into Noah's custody because he is simply a \"family friend\". Noah calls in Tracy Strauss<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Tracy_Strauss\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and meets her when she arrives in town. Tracy wonders why he called her and asks who he had planned to call if she had refused to come. Noah admits that he didn't have anyone else planned and Tracy smiles. She asks him what he is doing and Noah tells her about Jeremy, and his promise to help him. He then tells her that Jeremy is a lot like her in regards to letting his emotions control his ability  and Tracy reluctantly agrees to help after learning that Noah has forged some papers to make it seem as though Tracy is Jeremy's aunt. <br/>As Tracy speaks with Jeremy, Noah reads Jeremy's journal and learns that he has a lot of issues regarding his monstrous power. None the less, he and Tracy manage to get Jeremy released and Noah promises Jeremy that he will be safe as he has created a whole new identity for him. Noah and Tracy escort Jeremy out of the building, only to be met by a crowd of angry people. One man grabs Jeremy and succumbs to his ability. Noah begs Jeremy to heal the man but he does not and instead goes back to the police station. Noah and Tracy, after learning that Jeremy is not in his cell, go looking for him and find his dead body in the middle of the road. Noah is upset about letting Jeremy down and tells Tracy that he does not believe evolved humans <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Evolved_humans\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>can exist in the open. Grief stricken, Tracy tells Noah not to call her again and he walks away from her.  <br/>It was revealed that Noah wanted a romantical relationship with one of his co-workers but than again had a change of heart when realising that he could loose both Sandra and Claire <br/>Noah with the Haitian attended to Claire's college where he confronted Rebecca Taylor, than Samuel but ultimately he let them escape.<br/></p>",

    "deck": "A New York artist with the ability to paint the future. Isaac became aware that New York City was going to suffer a nuclear explosion and set the motions to \"save the cheerleader, save the world.\"",
    "description": "<p><b>Isaac Mendez</b> was an artist and comic book author living in Manhattan. He had a loft studio in Lower Manhattan. His art dealer and former girlfriend was Simone Deveaux. Isaac was addicted to heroin, although he had been through rehab twice. Many of his works of art are prophetic, accurately depicting events of the future. After he predicted his own death, Isaac was murdered by Sylar.</p><p>Urged on by his instructor, Dominick Cabalo, Isaac honed his art skills and took various summer classes to help develop his craft. It wasn't until high school when he began winning illustration contests. With even more classes in illustration and comic design courses under his belt, Isaac moved to New York and soon after high school took various courses in college for comic book illustration. It wasn't until the annual New York comic convention that he caught the eye of Camacho Comics and they hired him on the spot. He worked there for 3 years, all the while learning the ins and outs of the business. Then in 2002 he self-published his own line of comics under his old uncle Burk's name—one of the few people in his life who supported his love of comic books. (<i>9th Wonders!</i>, Issue #14)</p><h3>Season One</h3><p>Isaac discovers that whenever he paints while high on heroin, his paintings come true, which terrifies him enough to break up with Simone Deveaux, his girlfriend. When she brings Peter Petrelli to help him with his addiction, Isaac is found barely conscious, and a picture of a nuclear explosion in New York is painted on the floor. With Peter's help, who turned out to be able to do the same thing as Isaac, he finds a pattern in his paintings and figures out that saving a cheerleader is vital to prevent the explosion. Eden McCain comes and takes Isaac to Primatech Paper Co., where he meets with Mr. Bennet, the cheerleader's father, who tells him there's a serial killer called Sylar on loose, and that he will be after his daughter. Bennet says they will help Isaac to fight his heroin addiction, but he must help them stop Sylar first. However, Isaac cannot paint anything which could help Bennet with his goal - instead, he paints more of the explosion to come.</p><p>When he fully recovers from his drug addiction, Isaac leaves the Company's building and receives a call from Hiro Nakamura. When they meet, he learns of Hiro's friend's death by Sylar's hand and realizes he doesn't need drugs to paint the future anymore. When they return to Isaac's loft, they encounter Simone and Nathan Petrelli, and Isaac is told that Peter could be the source of the explosion. He attempts to paint Peter again and again, but is unaware that he is present on all of his paintings - he just cannot be seen. He has a moment with Simone, but unknown to them, Peter is watching. When Isaac paints a half-invisible Peter, he calls Mr. Bennet, who gives him a gun to fight Peter if needed. Soon, Peter arrives, driven by jealousy and anger for Isaac telling Bennet about him. The two face off and Simone is accidentally killed during the fight. Out of grief, Isaac reverts to his drug addiction and paints himself dead, with the top of his head removed. Later, Sylar comes after Isaac's power and kills him exactly as he had painted.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Isaac has the ability to \"paint the future\".</p><p>When Isaac is in a trance, he seems to be actually perceiving the future. His eyes become milky white and he sees the future events visually as if he's present. He also seems to have little awareness for sounds around him.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <i>9th Wonders!</i> might depict present or past events in addition to future events. Since Issue #14 was released in the future timeline, and since Simone mentioned that the comic was late in the present, then it's possible that the events depicting Hiro before his journey to New York and after his return to the present occurred before or as Isaac drew them. This potentially means that his ability includes present-time or past clairvoyance in addition to precognition.</p><p>Isaac also paints a picture of Peter standing in his room, seemingly the same time Peter becomes visible behind him (<i>Unexpected</i>). This may indicate that Isaac is able to paint present events as well. However, Isaac could have merely painted the event a few seconds before it happened.</p><p>Initially, Isaac had only painted future events while high on heroin. After going through rehabilitation under Eden's care, and with encouragement from Hiro and Ando, Isaac finally succeeded in painting (and sketching) events without the heroin, but with intense concentration instead. However, after Simone's accidental death, Isaac relapsed.</p><p>While the events portrayed in Isaac's paintings appeared to be random at first, Isaac has begun to show the ability to focus his paintings on a particular person. (<i>Distractions</i>)</p><p>According to the <i>9th Wonders!</i> comics, Isaac's power may include some form of translation of foreign languages.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><ul><li>Art supplies—used to produce paintings</li><li>Gun—given to Isaac by Mr. Bennet; used to accidentally shoot and kill Simone</li><li>Heroin—initially used by Isaac to access his powers</li><li>Paintings—the product of Isaac's prophetic visions</li><li>Primatech security keycard—given to Isaac by Eden McCain; presumably used to leave Primatech Paper Co.</li></ul>",

Hal was an abusive alcoholic and would often beat Niki and Jessica but Jessica usually took the beatings for Niki in their father's drunken rages. Niki took comfort in Jessica's calm and collected attitude and protection and came to rely on it. Unfortunately, Jessica, standing up for Niki and herself and becoming more domineering, was choked to death by her father when she was eleven. Niki witnessed the event and eventually Hal practically abadoned Niki. </p> <p>Niki, oddly had no memory of his abusive actions and simply believed that he ran out on her. She was soon married to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47666\" href=\"/dl-hawkins/4005-47666/\" slug=\"dl-hawkins\">D.L. Hawkins</a> and gave birth to his son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47675\" href=\"/micah-sanders/4005-47675/\" slug=\"micah-sanders\">Micah</a>.

As a gift to Micah and a apologetic gesture toward Niki, Hal gives Micah a laptop. Micah, an inventive genius, takes his laptop apart but Hal gets furious and lashes out breaking the table, Micah was working on.

Maury corrupts Niki by using her nightmares against her making her see D.L. and Jessica. Niki takes the syringe with the virus in it and breaks Mohinder's nose and knocks him out in several feats of superhuman strength.

After accidental and rare cases of displaying a low level of super strength, in the season 1 finale, How to Stop An Exploding Man, fully unlocks her potential to use superhuman strength and retains it without becoming Jessica.</p> <p>Niki suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), a mental illness where someone displays multiple distinct personalities with different identities, each with its own way of interacting with the environment. At least two personalities routinely take control of a person's behavior with associated memory loss and blackouts that go way way beyond normal forgetfulness and causes stem from child abuse. This applies to Niki and in her case the most prominent personality shown is Jessica. At the start of the series, Jessica only surfaces in times of stress, when Niki is in need or when Niki is in danger but surfaces with increasing and disturbing ease as the series moves on. The transformation between Niki and Jessica is immediate and almost unnoticeable besides Niki's sudden aggressive, angry, strong-willed and impulsive behavior. Jessica also freely demonstrates the superhuman strength and durability that Niki has just recently unlocked. She gains a tatoo like a RNA helix a repeated symbol. And like other extremely powerful heroes in the comic book world, Niki was only able to use her strength in her subsconscious or unconscious mind as Jessica.</p> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1719155\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5243362831858\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.4%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1719155\"><img alt=\" Super Strenght \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-width=\"452\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png\" data-srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png 452w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Super Strenght \" src=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png\" srcset=\"http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13820/1719155-imagen_3.png 452w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" data-width=\"452\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Super Strenght </figcaption></figure> <p>Jessica is named after Niki's late sister, Jessica, who took Niki's beatings for her, stood up for Niki and was usually always calm and in control.

Jessica has been around since after Niki's sister died and remembers the event while Niki doesn't. Niki though originally unaware finds a way to communicate and see Jessica in mirrors and reflective objects and the blackout effect weakens over time as the two personalities fight for control of their body.

    "deck": "Matt Parkman is a NYPD detective, the adoptive father of Molly and a former police officer from L.A. He has the power of telepathy, able to read, project, and control thoughts.",
    "description": "<a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Background</h2><p>Matt Parkman at age 13 was abandoned by his father, Maury Parkman, and raised by his absent-minded but well-meaning mother. Matt suffers from dyslexia and has a relatively low self-esteem thanks to his father's abandonment of him, his status as being overweight, and his dyslexia. Matt married Janice in his adult years and because of his lack of belief of himself in combination with his bad career as a beat Los Angeles cop with Janice's problems have strained their marriage but have nevertheless have been married 11 years.</p><p>Six months before the series premiere, Matt, while working as a traffic cop in L.A., came across Eden McCain, then known as Sarah Ellis, during a routine traffic check. When he asks for driver's license and a registration check on the car, Eden bluntly tells him that she stole it. When he asks her to step out of the stolen Lamborghini she tells him no and says that he should eat some donuts, like all cops. Obviously offended and upon seeing an open bottle of alcohol, Matt suggests she get out of the car quickly and Eden then uses her power of persuasion to tell him to leave her alone and go eat some donuts.

Mr. Bennett<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mr._Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> instructs a mysterious man <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Haitian\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to \"clean Matt out<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mental_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>\". Later, he discovers he has two marks<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mark\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> on his neck, something he shares in common with Ted Sprague<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Ted_Sprague\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, the FBI's newest target. </p><p>Obsessed with Mr. Bennet, Matt orders a SWAT  <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/SWAT\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> raid on Primatech Paper CO<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech_Paper_Co.\" rel=\"nofollow\">        .</a>, which ultimately proves to be a bust.

Desperate, Matt joins with the fugitive Ted to confront Mr. Bennet in his own home<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Bennets'_home_(Odessa)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. When things turn sour, Matt is apprehended by the Company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, but quickly escapes his cell<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt's_cell\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> with Bennet's help.

Matt uses Molly's locating ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Clairvoyance\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to hunt down Sylar at Kirby Plaza<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kirby_Plaza\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. However, just as he shoots the serial killer, Sylar telekinetically<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telekinetic\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> stops the bullets and flings them into Matt's abdomen, leaving him wounded.</p><h2>Generations</h2><p>Matt is now a detective with the NYPD<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/NYPD\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and lives with  Mohinder <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to take care of Molly<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. When picking up Molly from school<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Molly's_school\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, her teacher<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Miss_Gerber\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> shows Matt frightening drawings<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Drawings\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that Molly made of eyes intertwined with the symbol<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_symbol\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and informs him that she thinks Molly is living in a bad environment due to his recent injuries and divorce from Janice<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Janice\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. At their new residence<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder_Suresh's_apartment\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Matt and Molly eat, and Matt tried to talk to Molly about her drawings and her nightmares but she refuses. Later he uses his telepathy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to listen to Molly's dream and discovers that she is dreaming about the someone who can see her. She awakens and tells him that the person in her dreams is extremely dangerous, and if Matt tries to go after him he will die. </p><p>Matt is assigned with the investigation of Kaito<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Kaito\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s death. Detective Fuller<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Detective_Fuller\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> shows Matt a portion of a photograph of Kaito with the symbol<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_symbol\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> drawn on top. He informs Matt that Ando was a witness and that he saw Kaito being pushed off the building despite there being only one body found. Fuller continues and tells Matt that the photo had Angela Petrelli<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>'s fingerprint on it. While interviewing Angela, Matt hears her thoughts<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and finds out that someone is seeking revenge for something terrible they did. Matt meets Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> when Angela starts screaming in the interrogation room, and Matt breaks through the glass in the adjacent room. Nathan holds her as Matt asks who did this. Matt finds Angela holding another picture fragment of her with the symbol also drawn across her face. </p><p>The next few days, Matt and Nathan try to figure out who killed Kaito and attacked Angela. Nathan recognizes the photos<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Death_threats\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that the killer<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hooded_killer\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> sent to Kaito and Angela and shows the original <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Group_of_twelve\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to Matt. Matt sees his father<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mr._Parkman\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> in the photo and tries to get Molly<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Molly\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to find<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Clairvoyance\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> him. Molly uses her ability and becomes unconscious after revealing Matt's father's location. Matt and Nathan find Maury<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Maury\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and after finding that Maury is stronger than Matt with the same ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Maury escapes using his ability. Nathan and Matt find a picture of Bob<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Bob\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and go to warn him. Working with Niki<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Niki\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Mohinder<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Bob plans to capture Maury using Matt's ability. However, Maury outsmarts Niki and turns her against Bob, Nathan and Mohinder. After dealing with them, Maury finds himself in his old home where he is keeping Molly, and where Matt has found her. Matt argues with his father, then leaves the nightmare with Molly.  </p> <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Image:Powers_matt_telepathy_ok_ill_shoot_your_son.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>Matt discovers his ability allows for him to implant thoughts into other people's mind, and uses it to his advantage on Molly and Det. Fuller. Matt interrogates Angela Petrelli <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>to find out who the last woman in the photo is, but is too late to save her. Later, Angela explains to Matt and Nathan<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that 30 years ago<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Timeline:Pre-eclipse#November_2.2C_1977\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Adam<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Adam\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> decided the world needed to be wiped clean, and so the founders<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company's_founders\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> locked him away. Matt and Nathan are told to put a bullet through Adam's head to stop him, and before leaving, Matt hears Angela's thoughts, telling him to kill Peter, too, if he must. Matt and Nathan go to Primatech Paper CO<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech_Paper_Co.\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, and they run into <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Hiro\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>Hiro. They go to the Company vault<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Vault\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt tries to use his telepathy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to convince Peter to stop Adam, but Peter resists and starts pushing Matt back with telekinesis<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telekinesis\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Later, after Peter destroys strain 138<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Strain_138\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Matt, Nathan, and Peter discuss how they will expose and take down the Company<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/The_Company\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. With Matt's telepathic assistance, Nathan calls a press conference<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan's_press_conference\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to expose the nature of the various evolved humans<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Evolved_humans\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and the Company. During his speech, he is shot twice in the chest by an unknown assailant<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan's_assassin\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt looks up at the crowd, and tries to catch a glimpse of the shooter before he exits the building.<h2>Villains</h2>Matt rushes after Nathan Petrelli 's assassin <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Peter_Petrelli_(exposed_future)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> with Peter but arrives too late to catch him. Matt later finds \"Peter\" searching for the gun and demands some answers. Future Peter reveals<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Illusion\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> himself and teleports<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Space-time_manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> him to Africa, where he meets Usutu<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Usutu\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt travels with Usutu until they come to his camp, where numerous paintings of Matt are located. The paintings depict many different events in Matt's life and Usutu reveals that he can paint the future<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Precognition\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and that Matt has been one of his main subjects. Usutu proceeds to paint over an image of Matt in a happy family and instead paints Matt clutching the dead body of an unknown woman. After discovering that in the future, he is married to a woman named Daphne Millbrook<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Daphne_Millbrook\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Matt goes home to America<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/America\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to find her. Daphne finds him instead and attempts to recruit him to Pinehearst<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Pinehearst\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt tries to convince Daphne about the vision he had in Africa but she does not believe him until he mentions the name Daniella, which is the name of Daphne's grandmother. The two of them continue to talk and Matt tries to get Daphne to leave Pinehearst. Daphne tells him that she can't and runs away<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Super_speed\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>.   While at home, Matt is once again approached by Daphne, who has been ordered to kill him. Matt convinces her that she can't do it as she is a good person and the two of them go to Primatech<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Primatech\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to speak with Angela Petrelli. While there, Matt uses his Telepathy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to get inside Angela's comatose. Matt is almost killed by Arthur Petrelli<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Arthur_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> but Daphne manages to get inside and helps him. They rescue Angela but Daphne runs away, not wanting to be found by Arthur. Matt, Hiro and Ando go to Kansas to find her and after a new eclipse  occurs, Matt discovers that Daphne is unable to walk without her powers. When their powers return, Matt convinces Daphne that she is not a villain and that he does love her. The two of them return to Ando, who informs them that Hiro is missing in time. <p>Matt, Daphne and Ando return to New York <a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/New_York\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to find the final 9th Wonders! comic. After finding it, they learn that they need another time traveler to help Hiro, so Daphne steals an injection of the formula for Ando. Matt's ability is amplified by Ando's new power so Daphne and Ando use their combined powers to rescue Hiro. <br/></p><h2>Fugitives</h2><p>Two months later, Matt and Daphne are trying to live normal lives but are finding it hard to do so with Daphne's need for speed. Matt begins having visions of Usutu and is told by him that he is destined to become a prophet. Matt gains the ability of precognition and is then captured by the government. After escaping from the crashed Flight 195<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Flight_195\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Matt teams up with Mohinder<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mohinder\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Hiro to try and escape from them. The three of them meet up with Daphne, Ando and Claire<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Claire\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Daphne is shot by some agents, resulting in Matt going on a path of revenge. </p><p>Matt, Mohinder and Peter kidnap Noah Benett<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah_Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and use Matt's telepathy to get information out of him. Matt manages to discover that Daphne is still alive and goes with Peter to try and get evidence to use against Building 26<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Building_26\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt is captured and placed under sedation until he is freed by Tracy Strauss . Matt frees Daphne and takes her to the hospital, where he tries to give her a storybook ending. Daphne dies in his arms and Matt goes after Danko<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Danko\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, seeking to kill the one person he truly loves<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Alena\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt is unable to kill Alena and is rescued by Hiro, seconds before Danko shoots him. Hiro and Ando introduce Matt to his infant son, baby Matt .  </p>Now a father, Matt seeks to protect Baby Matt by returning him to Janice<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Janice\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. He faces many problems, as he does not know how much of a family they will be once they are all together once more. After returning Baby Matt to Janice, Matt goes to shut down Building 26 to ensure his son's safety. Before doing so, he is confronted by Angela Petrelli, who informs him that he is the only one that can save Nathan from being killed. The two of them go to Nathan's suite but arrive too late, as Nathan has been killed by Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Noah and Angela quickly come up with a plan to kill Sylar and bring back Nathan, and they get Matt to carry it out. Matt uses his telepathy to wipe away every memory and thought that Sylar has and replaces them with the memories and thoughts of Nathan, causing Sylar to fully become Nathan. Matt, angry and guilty over what he has done, leaves them and returns to his son.  <br/><br/><h2>Redemption </h2><p>Matt is playing with Matt Jr. when his phone rings. He answers it and discovers that Angela Petrelli<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is on the other end. She asks Matt  to erase Sylar's memories again but Matt denies her, stating that what he did was wrong and he has quit using his ability. Angels states there is no such thing but Matt tells her to deal with her own problem. He hangs up. </p><p>Matt goes to find Matt Jr. and almost trips on one of his toys. He discovers his son in the arms of Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, who calmly tells Matt that he wants his body back. </p> <a href=\"///\"> </a> <p>Matt confronts Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, saying that he is not real. Sylar tells Matt that he is part of his mind now and will not leave without his body. He comments that Janice<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Janice\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> is coming home and Matt worries. Sylar chucks baby Matt<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Baby_Matt\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to Matt and disappears. When Janice arrives Matt discovers that Baby Matt is fast asleep in bed.  </p><p>As Matt prepares for work, he discovers the water cooler guy, Roy<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Roy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, playing with Baby Matt. Matt isn't happy that he is on a first name basis with Janice and complains to her that he isn't sleeping well because he needs the name of this big drug lord but isn't using his ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> just like he promised. Matt goes to an officer's recovery group and talks about his problems. Sylar appears and taunts Matt, causing him to flip out in the middle of the group. Matt's partner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt's_partner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> witnesses this. He and Matt begin to interrogate a suspect but find him unwilling to talk. Sylar appears yet again and taunts Matt, causing him to eventually throw a chair, narrowly missing the suspect. Out of fear, the suspect gives the name to Matt. </p><p>Returning home Matt finds Roy there yet again. Matt offers him $100 to stay away from his family and then mentally persuades him to obey. Sylar is pleased with this and tells Matt that he got him.</p>Matt goes to work again with his partner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt's_partner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and the two enter a suspected drug dealer's home. Sylar appears to Matt and tells him that he doesn't want to be stuck in his mind. Sylar warns Matt of the drug dealer's actions and Matt listens, avoiding gun shots. Matt then captures the dealer and he and his partner begin searching for the drugs. Sylar teases Matt, stating he could find the location from the dealer<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> but Matt refuses to listen. Sylar leads him into a bathroom and tells Matt that something isn't right. They both notice a stuffed rabbit and Matt goes on to find a ransom note. <p>Matt beats the suspect and demands to know where the child is. He uses his ability and discovers that the little girl is dead beneath the stairs. Matt, outraged and appalled begins to beat the dealer until his partner arrives, stating that there is no body. Matt is shocked to learn this and Sylar reveals that he used his own ability against him. </p><p>Matt's partner tries to figure a way out of the situation but doesn't find one and tells Matt to get a lawyer. Matt tells him this will ruin his life and telepathically alters his partner's memories, causing him to forget what he saw. Sylar congratulates him on using his ability. </p> <a href=\"///\"> </a> <p>Matt has a nightmare in which he is making love with Janice<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Janice\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Suddenly, Sylar<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> takes over and continues making love with Janice. Matt awakens, believing it to be a dream. Janice hugs him and tells him that he was amazing. He then looks at Sylar, who is sitting and remarking that he enjoys \"forbidden fruit\". Matt soon finds Sylar, who continues to taunt him about the fact that he can take over his body. Matt warns Sylar that he will find a way to get rid of him. </p><p>Later, Matt is caught packing to leave by Janice. She asks him what he is doing and Matt explains that he has to leave to protect the family. Janice demands to know what has happened and Matt explains that he used his ability<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> to make someone believe he was another person<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. He then says that the man he did this to is a killer and that he has somehow latched onto his mind and can take control of his body. Janice tells him to stay at home and deal with it while she and Matty<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Matt_Jr.\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> leave for the night. After they leave, Matt sits alone and drinks. Sylar appears and talks about how Janice wishes that Matt were more like him. Matt then notices that every time he takes a sip of his alcohol, Sylar grimaces and groans in pain. Matt then drinks until Sylar disappears and he passes out. </p><p>\"Matt\" soon awakens and informs Janice and Mike<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Mike\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> that he is fine. Sylar then walks to the shower and Matt, now a telepathic projection, says that Sylar won't get away with this. Sylar laughs and asks if Matt would like his body back. </p> <a href=\"///\"> </a> <p><a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Sylar\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>Sylar is an airport, intent on finding out the truth of how he was trapped in Matt's body. As he passes through the X-Ray, the guards arrest him for bringing a gun. Matt tells him that Sylar thought he packed socks earlier but was actually packing a gun<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. Matt tells Sylar that even though he's controlling his body, he won't let Sylar control his ability. The police aptly takes him away. </p><p>As they are on the road, Matt and Sylar stop because they encounter a flat tire. Matt mocks Sylar, who though that he was in the \"driver's seat\". A truck comes along and stops. A man steps out and offers to help. Intent on proving that \"the world is his hostage\" and that he is really in the \"driver's seat,\" Sylar kills the man. Sylar demands no more sabotage in exchange for no more killings. </p><p>They arrive at the Burn Toast Dinner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Burnt_Toast_Diner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> where Sylar tells that he almost killed a waitress<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Charlie\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> there once. Sylar demands to know the truth from Matt. Matt eventually tells him that he, Angela Petrelli<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Angela_Petrelli\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> and Noah Benett<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Noah_Bennet\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> \"changed\" him into Nathan. Sylar sets out to kill everyone who was even \"remotely involved\" to what happened to him. </p><p>While Matt and Sylar are still at the Burnt Toast Dunner<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Burnt_Toast_Diner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>, Matt makes Sylar subconsciously<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Telepathy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a> write down on a napkin that he has a gun. Sylar gives the napkin to Lynette<a href=\"http://heroeswiki.com/Lynette\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a>. When they go outside, Sylar is surprised to see the police, but Matt has it all planned out. Matt forces Sylar into pretending to take out a gun from his jacket, thus prompting the policemen to shoot him. </p><p>In an ambulance, the paramedics try to resuscitate Matt.    <br/><br/>Matt was taken to a hospital in Texas where Peter and Nathan arrived to seek for answers about a dead body who looks a lot like Nathan.Matt told them that Sylar killed Nathan by cutting his throat and used his telepathy ability to transforms Sylar into Nathan and purge out his conscious but somehow Sylar trapped into Matt head and now whit one touch, Sylar can go back to his body which happens and after a fight with the local hospital guards, 'Nathan'  and Peter escape.Matt played the dead body and after erasing the guards memory of the happens he took it's clothes and went home while calling his wife Janice telling him that all of this nightmare is over. <br/> <br/>Few weeks later, Noah Bennett came to Matt for asking his help to track down a guy named Samuel Sullivan at first Matt agreed to help and they took answers from Samuel girlfriend, Vanessa but after a clash with Samuel and his right hand man, Eli Matt gave up and suggested Noah to do the same before someone gets hurt. <br/> <br/>Few days later Matt arrived home from work only to found Sylar with Janice talking.Matt asked what is this and Janice claimed that Gabriel has come to them for dinner.Matt took Sylar downstairs to talk and Sylar wanted Matt to go inside his head once more and purge out his powers or he will use all of them at once to end everyone nearby. <br/> <br/>After a long discussion and threatening Janice, Matt agreed to help but trapped Sylar's mind in his own fears of being-living and dying alone. <br/> <br/>Later that night, Matt began burying Sylar into his wall where he will suffer for eternity due his rapid cellular regeneration which slows down the aging and can live for hundreds of years,but suddenly someone knocked at the door:It was Peter Petrelli who entered the house,took Matt's ability and went downstairs where he entered Sylar's mind to get him out from the 'cage' so he can save Emma from killing thousands of people on Samuel's order.</p><h2>Powers and abilities</h2><p>Matt is a telepath, but he is not a fully realized telepath. Initially he was unable to activate it at will and only able to passively overhear thoughts and had trouble figuring out whose thoughts he was hearing. Through practice and repetition, he learns to read specific thoughts from people, going deeper if needed and to tell the difference.</p><p>The very nature of Haitian's powers is able to nullify Matt's, naturally shielding those thoughts of others in his vicinity. Matt's sheer power as a telepath has enabled him to briefly overcome Haitian's psychic shielding twice, the second time giving him a nosebleed due to the strain. But generally he is completely unable to read the Haitian's mind, something he describes as a sort of silence similar to white noise. </p><p>Against other telepaths such as his father, Maury Parkman, and Peter Petrelli who are using their telepathy, Matt finds it difficult to read or enter the minds, often causing an uncomfortable feedback. He also states in the episode Nothing to Hide that he has a problem discerning and locating the specific thoughts of people in crowds causing him to feel overwhelmed and pass out. Matt also has trouble understanding the thoughts of those who speak a foreign language.</p><p>As of Volume 2: Generations, Matt is on his way to being a fully realized telepath. Bob Bishop, the head of the Company, and his own father have stated that Matt should be able to exercise complete control over all aspects of the mind, memories, thoughts, actions, senses, etc. He first begins to use his telepathy on another scale when he begins to telepathically communicate with others like when he and Nathan Petrelli were trapped in a nightmarish illusion and with a comatose Molly Walker. </p><p>Later, when he confronts the Nightmare Man AKA his dad, he learns that he is able to enter the minds of others and warp it to trap them in a coma or a catatonic state with a dream or nightmare scenario. He uses this ability to overpower and imprison his father in a deep sleep with his own nightmares and fears. </p><p>In the episode, Cautionary Tales, he learns that while he can read the thoughts of other people and psychically converse with them by allowing them to hear his thoughts, then he can twist and influence the thoughts and actions of others by implanting mental suggestions and commands as a form of mind control. With practice, he seemingly masters this ability easily making Molly and his boss change their mind and do things and overcomes Angela Petrelli's formidable will. In the season 2 finale, Powerless, he was able to engage in a psychic tug-a-war with Peter Petrelli, signaling that telepaths can easily combat other telepaths and can win or lose, as he does when he overpowers Peter, forcing him to let Hiro go.</p><p> In Volume Four, the combination of the growth of his telepathy and the precognitive visions induced by Usutu grants him access to the \"same plane of consciousness\" that other precognitive characters access for their own powers, allowing him to draw the future. </p><a href=\"///\"> </a><h2>Alternate future<br/></h2><p>In the season 1 episode, Five Years Gone, when Hiro and Ando travel into the future accidentally, Matt is the director of the Department of Homeland Security and is directly involved with President Nathan Petrelli, who is actually Sylar in disguise. He has become ruthless and misguided, hunting down other super-humans and arresting them for terrorism. He mercilessly kills Hana Gitelman, Mr. Bennett, and Future Hiro but still has a soft spot for his family, Janice and his son, Matthew Jr. He has a developed a great deal of control with his powers, being able to affect memories and not only thoughts, and relive those memories. Also, he is able to endeavor deeper into the mind, reading and understanding more complex thoughts and painful rip thoughts from others.</p><p> In the alternate future \"I Am Become Death\" , in which abilities are publicly available, Matt is living with his adoptive daughter Molly, his wife Daphne, and his own infant daughter. He attempts to talk his wife out of tracking down Peter. He watches Daphne die in his arms when she returns after trying to escape the nuclear explosion in Costa Verde.      </p>",

Nathan was mercilessly killed by Sylar. Sylar now believes he's Nathan because of a mindwipe, therefore carrying on his legacy and role as Senator.",
    "description": "<p>Nathan, ambitious, pragmatic and an aspiring politician inspired by his father, sought to one day help the world by occupying a high position in the government. Nathan made many questionable choices and did or supported many bad things during his long and painful struggle for power. In the end, Nathan, upon succeeding in becoming New York State Congressman, realized how much his efforts had cost him when his beloved, yet somewhat estranged, younger brother detonated above the city. Resigning from office, Nathan went through a long period of depression, steadily driving his friends and family away. Though with time, coupled with Peter's return, Nathan resolved to make things right. To this end, he attempted to reveal the existence of evolved humans to the world, only to suffer an assassination attempt. Miraculously recovering, Nathan attributed his healing to an act of God, and believed evolved humans to be God's servants to His will on Earth. To this end, Nathan accepted the position of Junior Senator of New York, with Tracy Strauss as his aide. After discovering that his parents had injected him with the formula at a young age, Nathan eventually pledged his allegiance to his father's plans to synthetically give people abilities, despite his father's previous attempts to kill Nathan. Unfortunately, these plans failed, so Nathan revealed the existence of evolved humans to the President, like he tried to at the press conference before he was shot. They both agreed to have the government capture them and place them in a facility where no harm could be done. Despite having turned against his own kind, he still tried his best to keep his family members safe, even if it meant risking his own secrets coming out. His biological body was killed by Sylar, who had already obtained Nathan's form andmemories in order to meet and replace the President. However, at Angela's insistence, Matt Parkman questionably used both abilities against Sylar by transferring Nathan's memories and forcing Sylar to believe that he was Nathan. For months, Sylar was living Nathan's life, unaware of his true identity, but \"Nathan's\" conscience resurfaced, and it seemed that Nathan wasn't willing to go down without a fight. The two battled for control over the body. After Peter used mental manipulation to help Nathan's conscience regain control one last time, Nathan discovered that Sylar was too powerful for him and tried to throw himself a roof. While hanging onto Peter's arm, he said his goodbyes to Peter before falling, appearing to finally \"die\", turning back into Sylar just before he crashed into a car below.</p><h3>==Volume 1==</h3><p>Nathan Petrelli was a senator in New York City.He denied of having any supernatural ability until his brother proofed him that truth.He worked against Daniel Linderman with the FBI.He had a romantic affair with Nikki Sanders in Las Vegas which he intended to keep a secret against his wife.

It is currently unknown how he propelled himself or what speeds or altitudes he was capable of achieving, but judging by the sound of his flight when escaping from Mr. Bennet and The Haitian (<i>Hiros</i>), he was probably supersonic. His power, according to Angela Petrelli, was synthetic, and created by the same formula that gave abilities to Niki,Tracy, and Barbara (<i>Angels and Monsters</i>). He was capable of carrying people with him over long distances as shown when he flew with Peter to Haiti, Matt to Philadelphia and Texas, and Claire to Mexico.</p>",

    "deck": "A former watchmaker who discovered his superhuman abilities and became a serial killer obsessed with obtaining the powers of others. Currently reformed.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Gabriel Gray was a watchmaker obsessed with the idea of being special. While working in his father's shop he was approached by Dr Chandra Suresh, who believed that Gray might be \"Patient Zero\". After some tests, however, he determined that he had been incorrect and left. Angered, Gray tracked down the next person from Suresh's list and, finding that he had a complete understanding of the man's telekinesis, murdered him and copied it for himself. Intensely remorseful about this murder, he nonetheless contacted Suresh again, and the pair worked together for some time, tracking down various other powered individuals. However, Suresh eventually realized that Gray was murdering everybody that they located. Confronted by Suresh, Gray murders him as well, and sets off on a nationwide murder spree, tracking other powered individuals and acquiring their powers.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Sylar was created by <a href=\"/jeph-loeb/4040-40472/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40472\">Jeph Loeb</a> for the popular television series <i>Heroes</i>. He made his first appearance in the third episode of the first season, \"One Giant Leap\".</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Genesis</h3><p>Sylar's pattern of serial homicides begins to draw the attention of the <a href=\"/fbi/4060-55443/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\">FBI</a>, most of whom do not believe he actually exists. In <a href=\"/texas/4020-55822/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55822\">Texas</a> he encounters <a href=\"/hiro-nakamura/4005-47668/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47668\">Hiro Nakamura</a>, who defeats him in a fight, and who later persuades him to save <a href=\"/charlie-andrews/4005-48122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48122\">Charlie Andrews</a> by offering to tell Sylar his future. Sylar does so, but is unhappy to learn that he is destined to die unhappy and unloved. Sylar tries to take the power of <a href=\"/claire-bennet/4005-47664/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47664\">Claire Bennet</a> but is prevented from doing so and is gravely injured in the attempt, allowing him to be captured and experimented on for some time by <a href=\"/the-company/4060-50002/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50002\">the Company</a>. He manages to escape his confinement, and returns to his quest for new powers. This bring him in contact with <a href=\"/mohinder-suresh/4005-47676/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47676\">Mohinder Suresh</a>, whom he deceives in much the same way as he had his father. Like his father, Mohinder eventually realises Sylar's true nature and incapacitates him, experimenting on him briefly before himself being incapacitated. Resolving to only kill those who do not deserve their powers, he visits his adoptive mother seeking reassurance. When he displays his powers she panics, ultimately resulting in her own death. Sylar concludes he is on the right path and travels to Kirby Plaza where he faces off against a number of heroes. He is stabbed through the stomach by Hiro and collapses, mortally wounded.</p><h3>Generations</h3><p>He is rescued from his mortal wounding by a woman named Candice Wilmer. After numerous surgeries to repair his wound he awakes to find himself unable to use any of his stolen powers. Despite Candice's assurances that he will recover them he kills her and attempts to steal her power, but fails. He flees and wanders through <a href=\"/mexico/4020-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55820\">Mexico</a> for several days before being rescued by fugitive twins <a href=\"/maya-herrera/4005-52483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52483\">Maya</a> and <a href=\"/alejandro-herrera/4005-57095/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57095\">Alejandro Herrera</a>. He travels with them in their quest to meet Chandra Suresh, revealing neither his previous connection to the doctor, nor the fact that he is dead. Maya trusts Sylar implicitly, but Alejandro is less trusting. Eventually, Sylar is able to force Alejandro from the group, and murders him when he attempts to return. He and Maya arrive at Mohinder's home where, after revealing his true nature and engaging in a brief fight, he steals the cure for the disease that is preventing him from using his powers and flees.</p><h3>Villains</h3><p>The cure works and he regains his telekinesis, but all of his other powers have disappeared. He immediately sets off to acquire more powers, finally succeeding in taking Claire's, although he decides not to kill her. He is soon captured by the mysterious group known as the Company, who imprison him. He meets <a href=\"/angela-petrelli/4005-57706/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57706\">Angela Petrelli</a>, who offers to rehabilitate him and claims to be his real mother. Sylar becomes dedicated to rehabilitating himself, though he has difficulty controlling his hunger for power, which causes some difficulty in his work rounding up criminal superhumans. He is approached by Pinehearst Industries, who offer to allow him to continue murdering others and stealing their powers, but he declines. Later, he attempts to stop <a href=\"/peter-petrelli/4005-47678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47678\">Peter Petrelli</a> from going to Pinehearst, but is defeated and placed in a medical coma. Going to rescue Peter, he is confronted by <a href=\"/arthur-petrelli/4005-58326/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58326\">Arthur Petrelli</a>, who reveals that Sylar is capable of acquiring powers without killing. Soon it is revealed to him that Angela had lied about his parentage and, betrayed and angry, he gave up on attempting to reform. Instead, he traps the Bennet family and Angela in a facility, planning to murder them all. He is stabbed in the back of the head, which prevents him from healing or reviving, and is left alone in the facility, which explodes.</p><h3>Fugitives</h3><p>Surviving the explosion when the heat melts the glass in his head, Sylar begins the hunt for his birth parents. To this end he tracks down and tortures a number of people who may have the information, including his adoptive father. During his hunt he is ambushed by agents of <a href=\"/nathan-petrelli/4005-47677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47677\">Nathan Petrelli</a>, whom he is able to easily defeat. Taking one of the agents hostage, he invades the home of Luke Campbell, who reveals that he knows something of Sylar's real father. The pair travel to a diner that Sylar recalls from his childhood, and Sylar is able to recover memories of his childhood, including the fact that he witnessed his father killing his mother. Sylar finally finds his father, who is dying of cancer, and learns that he inherited his power to take the powers of others from his father. After the pair fight Sylar leaves him to die slowly of his disease. He next joins Emile Danko in his hunt for superhumans, with the obvious ulterior motive of acquiring more powers and killing fellow superhumans. During their first mission he acquires the power to shapeshift, which causes trouble for him as he finds it increasingly difficult to fully shift back into his true form, as well as finding that some of the memories and traits of those he impersonates continue to linger in his mind, driving him to an identity crisis. Impersonating Nathan, he formulates a plan to impersonate the President of the United States. Confronted by Nathan, he defeats him, but is then attacked by Danko, allowing Nathan to escape. He frames Danko for murder and eventually kills Nathan, stealing the latter's power and identity. He is then captured and psychically convinced that he is actually Nathan by <a href=\"/matt-parkman/4005-47673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47673\">Matt Parkman</a>.</p><h3>Redemption</h3><p>Living as Nathan, he begins to recover some memories of being Sylar as well as absorbing unsavoury memories from Nathan's past, which eventually results in him being shot and left for dead in a shallow grave. Reviving, he finds he has amnesia, and wanders until he encounters a travelling carnival that houses powered individuals. Attempts are soon made to recover his memories, and he finds himself repulsed at who he used to be. Soon the Nathan persona reasserts itself and he flees the carnival, seeking aid from his \"brother,\" Peter. The pair are eventually shown the true Nathan's dead body, and together seek Matt Parkman, who was responsible for turning Sylar into Nathan. Matt, meanwhile, is being tormented by Sylar's mind, which has latched onto his own and attempts to force Matt to reunite his mind and his body. Eventually, Sylar manages to take control of Matt's body, though Matt resists and almost manages to commit suicide. However, they are rescued by Nathan and Peter, and Sylar is able to orchestrate the return of his mind to his body despite the resistance of the Nathan persona, which ultimately dies. He next seeks out Claire, and after a discussion with her he determines that removing all of his powers is the only way for him to be happy again. He forces Matt to remove his powers, but Matt fails and instead traps Sylar in a nightmare and locks his unconscious body in the basement of his house. He is joined in the nightmare by Peter, and the pair reconcile over several years of dream time and eventually orchestrate an escape from Sylar's mind.</p><h3>Brave New World</h3><p>Newly freed, the pair attempt to leave Matt's home, which Matt allows only after being convinced that Sylar has changed. Sylar and Peter then travel to <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> where they rescue Emma Coolidge from Eric Doyle. Sylar reflects that rescuing Emma and defeating, but not killing, Doyle made him feel good. He decides to use his powers for good, and embarks on his career as a hero.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Sylar's original, inherent ability is the power to innately understand exactly how things work, an intuitive aptitude for understanding the workings of things. Sylar used this innate ability to understand and take the abilities of other evolved humans for himself by physically studying their brains. It is later revealed that he can obtain the abilities of others without killing them. It is unknown whether this manifestation is related to empathic mimicry or just a different method of using intuitive aptitude to understand an ability.</p><p>With his ability comes a 'hunger' for more knowledge and power. Sylar believes that it is this hunger that drives him to murder others and steal their powers. He is capable of suppressing this hunger but has in the past found it difficult to resist.</p><p>As a result of his ability Sylar has held or currently holds many different powers that he has stolen or mimicked. Notable acquisitions are telekinesis, regeneration, and electrical manipulation. The capacity for powers he can hold at once is unknown, theoretically limitless. His ability is known to be blocked by the Shanti virus, and acquiring it deleted almost all of the previous powers he had acquired.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Gone</h3><p>Five years in an alternate future, Sylar is blamed by President Nathan Petrelli for an explosion that destroyed New York. Believed to be dead, he murders Nathan and impersonates him, declaring war on all superhumans. He soon learns that a number of heroes are massing to rescue Hiro, and he confronts them. The result is unknown.</p><h3>I Am Become Death</h3><p>Four years in an alternate future, Sylar has returned to his life as Gabriel Gray and suppressed his hunger for powers in order to take care of his young son. However he is sought by Peter Petrelli, who needs help using Sylar's intuitive aptitude. A team lead by Claire soon attack hoping to kill Peter, but instead kill Sylar's son. Enraged, he loses control of his powers and causes an explosion which levels the town they are in. His fate is unknown.</p><h3>Seven Minutes to Midnight</h3><p>Sylar originally kills Charlie Andrews and takes her power. He is prevented from doing this by Hiro, and ultimately ends up saving Charlie's life instead.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><b><i>Heroes</i></b></p><p>Sylar appears in all seasons of the television show <i>Heroes</i> as a major antagonist. He is played as an adult by Zachary Quinto, and as a child by Joshua Rush.</p><p><b><i>Robot Chicken</i></b></p><p>A parody of Sylar appears in a sketch on the comedy program <i>Robot Chicken</i>. He is played by Zachary Quinto.</p>",

He tricked her into wearing a mask of Sonic that makes everyone you look at appear to be Snively. While wearing this mask, she cut a rope she THOUGHT Snively was climbing, but it was really Sally. Horrified at what she'd done, she furiously beat up Drago, and nearly killed him by throwing a rock at his head. Fortunately, the princess didn't die, and Hershey was forgiven for being Drago's dupe (Sonic #50). She was later recruited for the Secret Service, bringing to the team her computer skills.

Bored with his life at a military school, he reads books about military history. Ulysses later scares the bullies that pick on him into helping him to escape the school, and work as his henchmen. He goes to <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a> to recruit gang members into his \"army\", uses his military skill to grow his gang, and has taken on <a href=\"/black-mask/4005-3724/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3724\">Black Mask</a>'s gang. His reputation gains him the nickname \"<b>The General</b>\". He dresses himself and his henchmen, primarily gangs he has conquered, in historical attire as they act out crimes based on military history.</p><p>While his father, sister and brother know of his psychosis and the threat he poses, his mother is blind with affection for him, even as he is being hauled into juvenile hall after his crimes are foiled by <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>. The General has been expanded beyond Batman into the larger DC Universe and has also taken on <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a> separately.</p><p> </p><p>The General has teamed up with other costumed criminals, including a henchman of <a href=\"/maxie-zeus/4005-11343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11343\">Maxie Zeus</a> known as <a href=\"/julie-caesar/4005-112706/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-112706\">Caesar</a>. Picking up the dillusional criminal in a museum, he brought Caesar home (much to the dismay of his father). The General and Caesar use a stolen circus lion to threaten a biker group known as \"Los Bandidos\" into becoming their henchman. Wanting even more members for the gang, they set out to conquer an enemy gang. A fight erupts between the biker gangs but is stopped quickly by Robin (who has used detective skills, intel from the General's sister, and the help of Sheriff <a href=\"/shotgun-smith/4005-13169/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13169\">Shotgun Smith</a> to find the General) and Shotgun Smith. The General and Caesar steal money from the back, jack a police car and would've gotten away if Robin hadn't stopped them using \"the <a href=\"/the-redbird/4055-55692/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55692\">Redbird</a>\". The General then went to jail for a number of weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Several weeks later, the General teamed up with <a href=\"/toyman/4005-1814/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1814\">Toyman</a>, as they plan to steal a toy collection made by Schott from a collector. Robin tracks them down to the collector's house, to find that Schott (a homicidal maniac who hates kids to begin with) pointing a gun at Ulysses. The General saves himself using an automized panzer toy, a train and help from the boy wonder. After the two crooks are caught, Ulysses claims that Toyman made him do it and only serves a brief sentence in jail.</p><p> </p><p>Once out, he meets the pre-teenaged ruler of an Eastern country and they become fast friends. Deciding to help the ruler thwart his enemies, the General travels to his aquantice's home country, and wages war. Hiring <a href=\"/gunhawk/4005-24030/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24030\">Gunhawk</a>, the NK Demon, <a href=\"/hatchet/4005-23729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23729\">Hatchet</a>, and <a href=\"/deadline/4005-18548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18548\">Deadline</a> (four dangerous mercenaries) and using a vast army, Ulysses is on the brink of comitting genoside when Robin and <a href=\"/dick-grayson/4005-1691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing</a> show up in a bat-plane. Robin stops the mercenaries and is about to grab the General when he sees that Ulysse's \"friend\" is unhappy with the General for starting a war. Now a slave, the General spends several years scrubbing floors and cleaning palaces.</p><p> </p><p>After a very long absence, the General has returned to Gotham City, having aged several years, grown several feet and has become a more formidable hand-to-hand combatant. He physically appears closer in age to Robin and <a href=\"/stephanie-brown/4005-6156/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\">Spoiler</a>. He has for reasons yet unknown been hired by Spoiler to gather information about the Gang Wars, and find a possible solution to them. He continues to hold a grudge against Robin and betrays Spoiler. Spoiler survives a gunshot to the shoulder, and then distracts him long enough to get the drop on him and escape.</p><p> </p><p>He comes into possession of the <a href=\"/red-robin/4005-40197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40197\">Red Robin</a> costume worn by <a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a>, and uses it as part of a campaign of psychological warfare against <a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake</a>. More formidable than ever, he's revealed to be holding <a href=\"/anarky/4005-10697/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10697\">Lonnie Machin</a>, an anarchist vigilante, hostage and to have commandeered the latter's identity as \"Anarky\". Where Machin's approach as Anarky had been to cause social change, Armstrong's approach bordered more on psychotic and meaningless acts of chaos and destruction.</p><p> </p><p>Armstrong manages to catch Robin in his warehouse, yet Robin escapes through unknown means, but not without sustaining serious burns to his head. Soon after, a final confrontation ensues, where Anarky attempts to kill all of Gotham City's Gangs, so as to create more violence. The combined efforts of Robin, Spoiler, <a href=\"/james-gordon/4005-3727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon</a>, <a href=\"/officer-harper/4005-51360/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51360\">Officer Harper</a> and the Gotham Gangs, results in Armstrong's defeat. However, not without a price. In order to take the edge off of Armstrong, Robin asked Officer Harper to bring the Armstrong Family to confront Ulysses. Unfortunately, while the action worked, Armstrong caused a bomb to explode, killing his brother and sister in the blast. Armstrong blames Robin for their deaths.</p><p>Managing to escape from the Police, Armstrong returns to his hideout where he has Lonnie Machin paralyzed. There the pair of them argue about the true meaning of Anarchy, in which Ulysses states he could create enough anarchy with only one question: \"Who is Robin?\" </p><p>After Scarab's failed attempt to murder Tim Drake, Anarky (Armstrong) took it upon himself to destroy Red Robin once and for all. Ulysses begins killing three possible canidates that he presumed were Red Robin and wrote off Tim Drake as the fourth since the assassination attempt on Tim along with the capture of Scarab made by Red Robin was done simultaneously. Ulysses automatically concludes that his fifth candidate is Red Robin. Fortunately, Tim was working with Lonnie Machin's cyber persona Moneyspider and learned the location of the fifth candidate. Tim saves the target and immobilizes Ulysses but Ulysses has an insurance policy in case Machin reached out to anybody. Ulysses rigged his hideout to blow and tells Tim the exact location. Tim manages to save Machin but Anarky regains his mobility and escapes. </p>",

    "deck": "Michelle Carter is the younger sister of Booster Gold and traveled into the past to be a superhero like her brother.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Michelle is the sister of <a href=\"/booster-gold/4005-1786/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1786\">Booster Gold</a> and thus also originates from the 25th century. At one point Booster needed to return to his original era to be cured of a disease and he reconnected with Michelle during this time. Unexpectedly though she decided to <a href=\"/time-travel/4015-55712/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55712\">travel with him to the past</a>. With more resources in the present day than in the future she decided to travel the world, in part helped by Booster’s money. Unknown to her brother though she took the Goldstar uniform along with her so that she could get a better impression of what Booster does in his superhero career.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldstar was created by <a href=\"/dan-jurgens/4040-4321/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4321\">Dan Jurgens</a> and she appeared first in <a href=\"/booster-gold-1-the-big-fall/4000-26451/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-26451\"><em>Booster Gold #1</em></a> (1986). She would only appear as her superheroine identity some time later.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Michelle was initially portrayed as a character not as interested in superheroics for the same reasons as most other heroes, but as she has characteristics more in line with those of brother. Despite this she has made herself relatively well known as a competent heroine in her career.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Goldstar uniform was not first used by Michelle but rather by <a href=\"/trixie-collins/4005-47832/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47832\">Trixie Collins</a>, Booster’s secretary. She uses the suit to save Booster from being killed by a mob of anti-superhero activists when he is in the hospital. She later travels to the 25th century with him and the suit but by this point she has already decided she has no interest in a superhero career. Instead when Michelle returns to the past she decides to take the suit for herself. She is eventually killed by a group of aliens that were planning on invading <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth.</a> Years later though it is revealed that did in fact not die and that Rip Hunter, the famous time traveler had saved her moments before her death (unknown to her or Booster he is also her nephew.) Because she was in the past already out of the timeline saving her from death was determined to not having overall effect of the time stream.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After returning to life she became a partner of her brother’s in his time traveling adventures. She eventually discovers that she died in the past. She initially has a hard time dealing with the fact that she had returned from the dead, and despite <a href=\"/skeets/4005-13107/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13107\">Skeets</a>’ attempt to make her feel better it exacerbated the problem by making her feel overly protected. She departs through a time portal before Booster can get back to find her.</p><h4>The Tomorrow Memory</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Goldstar finds herself in the past and for some unknown reason finds herself in <a href=\"/coast-city/4020-47879/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47879\">Coast City</a>, with her boyfriend Drew, on the day that <a href=\"/cyborg-superman/4005-12926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12926\">Cyborg Superman</a> and <a href=\"/mongul/4005-12162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12162\">Mongul</a> destroy it. Lucky for her Booster finds her in time to take her back to the present, but unluckily Drew is forced to be left behind because he was destined to die in Coast City. Goldstar takes some time to forgive Booster but she does and joins Rip and Booster in protecting the time stream.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Michelle is otherwise a normal human. She comes from the 25th century but other than generic knowledge from the time frame, she is not considered particularly technologically adept. Her most important piece of equipment is the Goldstar costume. The costume gives her the ability to influence magnetism. This allows her to fly, move metallic objects, create force field, and fire beams of magnetism. The suit has also been modified by Rip to offer protection from the time stream.</p>",

She wears red boots and matching gloves and wears a brown shoulder sash across her left shoulder and a brown utility belt and has razor sharp claws that have come in handy time and time again.</p><h2>Downunda Freedom Fighters</h2><p>Barby Koala serves as the second-in-command of the Downunda Freedom Fighters. She along with her teammates ultimately serves the Kingdom of Acorn and at times she has proven to be more of an asset to the team , and sometimes is more decisive then the teams leader, Walt Wallabee. She has aided the Downunda Freedom Fighters countless times and has proven her worth to the team and to everyone else for that matter. Even though at times she appears to be a more suitable leader to the team, she is always ready and willing to fallow orders which has shown her to be extremely loyal. From the newest issues in Sonic Universe we come to find that she is fluent in ancient languages.</p><p> </p><h2>Romance</h2><p> Walt Wallabee has shown romantic interest in Barby as a potential love interest and has showed it in past issues. Tails also has been seen to have a crush on Barby and though she is much older then him, Barby has slightly flirted with him in the past due to the fact she thinks he is 'cute' and is flattered at the fact he takes such a large liking to her.</p><p> </p><h2>Personality </h2><p>Barby Koala is very kind and caring and expresses concern for both teammates and allies from other Freedom Fighter groups. She is an outstanding fighter and fierce in combat and takes it very seriously. Barby is extremely intelligent and is the teams peace-maker, so to say and she does her best to maintain that peace between all the hotheaded male teammates she works alongside with.</p>",

    "deck": "Toph is a blind girl who uses Earth Bending to \"see\". She is Aang's Earth, Bending teacher.  She is the only, person along ,her family to reveal, their surname.  Toph is also a master, Earthbender; she can, also metal bend.",
    "description": "<p><b>Toph</b> is one of the main characters of <a data-ref-id=\"4050-19410\" href=\"/avatar-the-last-airbender/4050-19410/\">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>, first introduced in Book 2: Earth. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly looked down upon for her disability and her stature as an innocent little girl, especially by her over-protective parents. Upon discovering Badgermoles, earth-dwelling animals who were blind just like her, she learned through them to use Earthbending as an extension of her senses and effectively give her \"sight\" through vibrations in the ground.</p><p>Known as the \"Blind Bandit\", she mastered Earthbending through her own style and developed a tough-guy personality, becoming infamous by winning underground Earthbending tournaments behind her parents' backs. Uninterested at first, she chooses to leave behind her old life and travel with Avatar <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47646\" href=\"/aang/4005-47646/\">Aang</a> and friends to be his Earthbending teacher. Toph's mastery over earth, especially with Metalbending, as well as her unique personality, proved her to be an invaluable addition to the Avatar's group.</p><p>Toph was first seen when Aang had a vision of her in a swamp.</p><h2><b>Background</b></h2><p>Toph is the only child of the wealthy Bei Fong family of Gaoling. Born blind, she was sheltered by parents who believed her blindness made her fragile and incapable of looking after herself. They went to extreme measures to protect her, including hiding her existence from the rest of the world. Toph, resenting her parents' treatment, grew up hard and rebellious. At the age of six, she ran away from home into a cave inhabited by Badgermoles. Badgermoles were the first earthbenders and according to Toph, she understood them, and they her, because they were both blind. She learned Earthbending by imitating their movements. Toph learned to \"see\" through the use of her Earthbending, feeling people and other objects through their vibrations, which she feels through the ground via her bare feet. She also has great hearing. Although her father, Lao Bei Fong, later hired the Earthbender <a data-ref-id=\"4005-54059\" href=\"/master-yu/4005-54059/\">Master Yu</a> to instruct her, he didn't teach her anything other than beginner moves, unaware that she had already become very powerful. She became such a powerful bender that she secretly entered underground Earthbending tournaments as the Blind Bandit, and was actually the champion of Earth Rumble Six, before Aang challenged her. She soon ran away to teach Aang Earthbending, and also to get away from her parents, who were overprotective of her.</p><h2><b>Book 2: Earth</b></h2><h4><b>The Blind Bandit</b></h4><p>Toph makes her first appearance in Aang's vision, although he does not recognize her. (\"The Swamp\") Aang recognizes her during Earth Rumble Six, realizing that she was in his vision and is perhaps the Earthbending teacher he has been searching for. Aang finds an opportunity to speak with her when the tournament host <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53973\" href=\"/xin-fu/4005-53973/\">Xin Fu</a> asks for a volunteer to challenge the champion of the tournament, but while Aang attempts to talk to Toph, she assumes he is only there to fight her and keeps attacking him. Finally, Aang overtakes her by using his airbending ability, which Toph cannot sense due to her blindness. Upset at losing, Toph leaves the arena without ever giving Aang a chance to explain who he is and why he is searching for her.</p><p>After asking around, Aang finds her once again at the Bei Fong Estate and tried to explain why he needs an Earthbending teacher, but Toph calls for the guards. Aang flees, but he isn't ready to give up. He returns later, officially visiting the Bei Fong family, and is invited to dinner, where he attempts to talk to Toph's father about her Earthbending and his need for a teacher. Toph tries to silence him since her parents know nothing about her secret life as the Blind Bandit. Tensions run high between Aang and Toph, but they finally reconcile after dinner when she explains about her parents and her ability to \"see\" through her bending. Their conversation is cut short when they are kidnapped by the members of Earth Rumble Six, because, by \"The Boulder's\" account, Toph seemed to have lost intentionally, since he did not see Aang Earthbending when Toph fell in the arena.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph%27s_vision.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph%27s_vision.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/c/c6/Toph%27s_vision.png/250px-Toph%27s_vision.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph%27s_vision.png\" /></a></p><p>Xin Fu, the host of Earth Rumble Six, demands that his money be returned in exchange for Toph and Aang. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25622\" href=\"/katara/4005-25622/\">Katara</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47733\" href=\"/sokka/4005-47733/\">Sokka</a>, Master Yu and Toph's father go to the arena and repay all the money. Toph is released, but Aang is kept, as they decide that they'd get more money by turning him over to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48047\" href=\"/fire-nation/4060-48047/\">Fire Nation</a>. Katara asks for Toph's help in defeating the Earthbenders and rescuing Aang. Toph's father cuts Katara off, claiming once again that his daughter is too weak and blind to do any sort of fighting. Fed up with her father's assumption, Toph agrees to save Aang. Toph displays some amazing bending and easily beats all of the Earth Rumble Six contestants, as well as Xin Fu, much to the amazement of both her father and Master Yu.</p><p>Later that night, Toph explains her secret life to her parents, telling them that she hopes it will not change their opinion of her. Toph's father responds that it does not change his love for her at all, but he has instead realized that he has allowed her too much freedom, and she will henceforth be watched by guards at all times. He also declares the Avatar and his friends unwelcome in his home and forces them to leave.</p><p>Just as they are about to leave, Toph appears and tells them that her father has changed his mind. While both Sokka and Katara realize that she is lying and is in fact running away from home, Aang seems to believe that she is being genuine and accepts her into the group happily. Back at the Bei Fong Estate, Toph's father offers a large reward to Master Yu and Xin Fu if they recover his daughter, whom he assumes was kidnapped by the Avatar. (\" The Blind Bandit\")</p><h4><b>Starting out</b></h4><p>Not long after she joins the group, she starts a feud with Katara. As the group sets up camp, Katara notices that Toph is slumping lazily against a rock. Katara informs her that they usually divide the work among the group, implying she would like Toph to help them set up camp. Toph tells her not to worry, as she feels she can carry her own weight, suddenly Earthbending a triangular, earthen, makeshift tent with two slabs of stone. Katara rephrases her last statement, telling her that they all have a job to do, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48106\" href=\"/momo/4005-48106/\">Momo</a>, who then appears on her shoulder with berries. Toph refutes that she does not feel she has to help anyone else because no one needs to help her. Katara attempts once more to suggest to Toph that she help out, but all it does is further irritate her. Katara finally gives up and walks back to their campsite. Later on, Katara tries to reconcile with Toph for the previous argument, apologizing and noting that she thinks that they're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves. Toph, rather than sharing the blame and accepting her overture, simply agrees that she does seem a bit too tired and lays down to sleep. Katara, though clearly incensed by the insulting retort, brings herself to half-heartedly tell Toph goodnight and walks back to her own tent.</p><p>During the night, Toph awakens suddenly. Feeling the ground, she senses something approaching and alerts the rest of the group. When asked exactly that something is, all she can say is that it feels like an avalanche, but also not like an avalanche. After they leave the camp, the two grumpy girls continue to fight. Eventually, Toph picks up her belongings and leaves the group. Toph continues through the forest; however, she meets an old man, who happens to be <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47559\" href=\"/uncle-iroh/4005-47559/\">Iroh</a>. Toph has tea with Iroh on a small cliff. She comments that Iroh is probably thinking she cannot take care of herself as he would not let Toph pour her own cup of tea, but Iroh explains that he poured her tea only because he wanted to and for no other reason. Toph tells him that everyone treats her like she is helpless, but she can take care of herself. Iroh responds that she sounds like his nephew, mentioning how both seem to feel that they have to do everything themselves, but both have friends and family that love them and want to help them. He also adds that he has been trying to track <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47634\" href=\"/zuko/4005-47634/\">Zuko</a>, so that even though Zuko may want to be alone to figure out his problems at the moment, Iroh will be right there should Zuko need him. The meeting inspires Toph, and she decides to go back and find her friends, but first tells Iroh that Zuko is lucky to have an uncle like him and also that perhaps Iroh should tell Zuko that the uncle needs the nephew as well. That night, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47769\" href=\"/appa/4005-47769/\">Appa</a> lands on a rock formation, and Toph can be seen sleeping next to Katara and the others.</p><h4><b>Training Aang</b></h4><p>It is Toph's responsibility to teach Aang how to earthbend in preparation for the invasion of the Fire Nation. Her task, however, proves extremely difficult as the fundamentals of Earthbending are as far removed from those of airbending as is possible, and so Aang finds himself in conflict with his former training. Toph has very little patience for him and aggressively pushes him to learn to earthbend. She puts him through a series of basic tests, but Aang has trouble grasping the concept of Earthbending. He fails the first three tests, which include pushing a large boulder, lifting and carrying a boulder and pushing his fingers through solid rock. He performs slightly better in the next few tests, and Toph deems him ready for a harder test, where he has to hold his stance and stop a boulder that is rolling down a cliff towards him. However, Aang chooses to evade the rolling boulder, thus angering Toph.</p><p>Demoralized, Aang takes a break from training with Toph, who insults him for not being able to stop the rock, choosing to work on his waterbending with Katara. He returns to find Toph using his staff as a nutcracker, and he also notices that Sokka is nowhere to be found. He finds Sokka trapped in a crack in the earth and tries airbending him out. When that fails, Sokka asks him to Earthbend, but Aang tells him he cannot, nor can he get Toph because it would be too uncomfortable for him. The Sabertooth moose-lion Sokka was trying to capture earlier returns, closely followed by its mother, who charges at both Aang and Sokka. Aang stands his ground and defeats the mother using his airbending, saving Sokka. Toph, who was silently observing the conflict, half-heartedly congratulates Aang and continues cracking nuts with his staff. Incensed that she callously stood by and did nothing as Sokka's life was in danger, Aang forcefully demands that she return his staff. Toph then says that Aang is thinking like an Earthbender and tells him to try the rock again, which Aang is successfully able to accomplish. After deeming Aang a true Earthbender, Toph drags Sokka out of the hole, finally giving him freedom.</p><p><strong><b>Journey To Ba Sing Se</b></strong></p><p>After the group loses Appa, they must travel by foot. After they bump into a family (with a pregnant mother) and Sokka's old girlfriend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48104\" href=\"/suki/4005-48104/\">Suki</a>, they decide to pass the lake seperating them from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-52254\" href=\"/ba-sing-se/4020-52254/\">Ba Sing Se</a>, called the Serpent's Pass. They start to cross it, but then they come to a dead end in the middle of the sliverous path. Katara and Aang must waterbend a path through the water so that they could pass. While they are walking on the path, they discover why the name of the path is \"The Serpent's Pass\". It is guarded by a gigantic serpent that disrupts their waterbending. So, in order to stop them from drowning, Toph elevated the ground and brought them to the surface. This strands them in the middle of the water, with the serpent circling around them. Aang attacks the serpent, telling Katara to get the others across while he distracts it. Katara creates an ice bridge for the others to cross, then leaps to help Aang without a second thought. The others cross, except for Toph, who is afraid to go, until the serpent slams the ground behind her. She begins to cross, until the serpent destroys the ice, sending her into the water. Toph says she cannot swim, so Sokka calls that he's coming after her, but Suki dives in first and saves her. Toph, thinking that it was Sokka, gives Suki a kiss on the cheek before Suki can tell her the truth. She later does, much to Toph's embarrassment, stating \"You can go ahead and let me drown now.\" The group survives the ordeal, and they head to Ba Sing Se. On the way to Ba Sing Se, the pregnant mother starts to give birth. They name her \"Hope\" in the name of the journey they had while traversing the Serpent's Pass.</p><h4><b>Battle of the Drill</b></h4><p>Once the group arrives to Ba Sing Se, they are presented with even more trouble. A giant drill is trying to break down the walls of the mighty city. Sokka decides to get them to sabotage the drill. Toph refuses to enter the drill and instead tries to slow down the drill using Earthbending. After Katara gets out of the drill, she calls for Toph to help her bend the slurry in the pipes back to help bring down the drill. After Aang deals the final blow, the drill shuts down and the team is once more victorious.</p><h4><b>In Ba Sing Se</b></h4><p>Riding the Earth rail, the group finally enters Ba Sing Se. Sokka is confident that they will easily find Appa, but the city is bigger than they imagined... much bigger. Soon after they arrive, Toph and her friends are met by Joo Dee, a cheerful, incessantly-smiling woman assigned to guide them around the city. As a reward for protecting Ba Sing Se from the Fire Nation attack, Toph, Katara, Sokka and Aang are given a house in the city's upper ring.</p><p>In the upper ring, Aang and his group are finally taken to their new house. When a possible audience with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53805\" href=\"/the-earth-king/4005-53805/\">Earth King</a> is finally mentioned, it is revealed that they will have to wait at least a month. It soon becomes apparent that within the walls of the city, no one wants to talk or even think about the war raging in the rest of the world. Even Aang's attempts to find Appa bears no fruit as no one seems willing to divulge any information to them, thanks to some meaningful glances from Joo Dee. Along the way they also see members of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-52640\" href=\"/dai-li/4060-52640/\">Dai Li</a> — elite guards who safeguard Ba Sing Se's culture and society.</p><p>When a notice arrives of a party being held in the palace, Katara decides it's a good way to reach the Earth King. Toph says that since the gang is mostly commoners, they'd be spotted right away if they went to the event. In the end, Toph decides that Katara can pass off as a high born girl, and both of them dress up in formal attire. They then head for the palace while Aang and Sokka wait at the house. The girls are initially refused entry by a guard, who rejects even Toph's family seal. They eventually get inside by tagging along with an official named <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48108\" href=\"/long-feng/4005-48108/\">Long Feng</a>, but their attempts to sneak Aang and Sokka inside are stymied by Long Feng himself, who seems determined to personally help them out. Soon the Dai Li bind and gag Katara and Toph with Earthbending. They then go and have a meeting with Long Feng and learn that Ba Sing Se is really controlled by him rather than the Earth King.</p><p>One day, at the location of the gang's house in Ba Sing Se, the whole group busily cleaning themselves up for the day aside from Toph who has yet to wake up. When Katara wakes her, Toph presents herself with her hair a mess and her body covered in dust (or, \"a healthy coating of Earth!\") considering herself ready. Katara suggests they have a \"Girl's Day Out,\" and takes her to the Fancy Lady Day Spa. Toph agrees, as long as they don't touch her feet. This request is denied and Toph sends one of the attendants through the wall during a pedicure. The girls then take a mud bath where Toph uses her Earthbending to make creepy faces with the mud and scare away the attendant. The two then relax in a sauna, using their Bending to both feed the fire and create the steam.</p><p>The girls leave the sauna now with make-up on their faces. As they cross a bridge, a girl named <a data-ref-id=\"Star\" href=\"/wiki/Star/\">Star</a> and her friends make fun of Toph's make-up. Toph is upset by these remarks, and Katara tries to urge her to ignore them. Toph, however, laughs back at the girls and then Earthbends the rock of the bridge from under them, dropping them into the water. Katara finishes with her own parting shot by waterbending the girls downstream.</p><p>Katara tries to console Toph as they continue walking on. Toph claims that because she is blind, she does not have to worry so much about personal appearance or the approval of others, but the words of the girls still hurt her all the same, and she sheds a few tears. Katara compliments that Toph is not only confident and self-assured, but also pretty. Toph proclaims she would like to return the compliment but has no idea what Katara looks like. Katara laughs at this and the story ends with Toph giving her a friendly punch on the arm.</p><p>Out in the city, the gang is setting up more posters for the lost Appa when Katara runs into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48107\" href=\"/jet/4005-48107/\">Jet</a>. He tells her that he wants to help, but Katara distrusts him and attacks. Jet deflects her attacks and tries to prove his honesty by dropping his hook swords. The others arrive, drawn by the noise, and Jet tries again to explain himself. Then Jet shows them a flier. Toph, reading Jet's heartbeat and breathing patterns, pronounces that he's telling the truth. Katara is distrustful, but agrees. Jet leads them to a large empty warehouse, where he says they may have been holding Appa. Toph confirms it by finding a tuft of Appa's fur, and an old cleaning man says that Appa was sent off to Whale Tail Island, down near the South Pole. Aang immediately wants to set off, and Jet offers to come along. Toph asks Katara whether Jet was her boyfriend. She gets mad and says no, but Toph teases her by saying she can tell she's lying.</p><p>On their way out, the group is sidetracked when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50208\" href=\"/smellerbee/4005-50208/\">Smellerbee</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50255\" href=\"/longshot/4005-50255/\">Longshot</a> happen to come across them. Katara once again turns on Jet, as he had claimed to have left the gang behind. Jet insists that he's been living alone in the city, but Smellerbee claims that he was dragged away by the Dai Li. Toph realizes they are both telling the truth, even though their stories don't match. Sokka quickly figures that Jet has been brainwashed by the Dai Li. Katara uses her healing to try to soothe it. Jet remembers that he was taken to a secret facility under a lake. Sokka remembers what Joo Dee had said about her \"vacation\", fully jogging Jet's memory. The base is under Lake Laogai. The group makes their way to the lake the next day, and Toph quickly finds and uncovers the underwater entrance. They go inside, quietly making their way through the dark corridors.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_vs_Dai_Li.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_vs_Dai_Li.png/\"><img src=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/3/33/Toph_vs_Dai_Li.png/250px-Toph_vs_Dai_Li.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_vs_Dai_Li.png\" /></a></p><p>The gang find themselves confronted by Long Feng and several Dai Li agents. A battle quickly breaks out. Toph shows the true mastery of Earthbending when she incredibly takes down several Dai Li agents. Long Feng escapes, with Aang and Jet in hot pursuit. After dealing a grievous blow to Jet, Long Feng escapes as the others enter the chamber. Katara tries to heal Jet and realizes just how badly he was injured. Longshot, speaking for the first time in the series, tells Aang and his group that they should go and find Appa, and leave Jet to Smellerbee and himself. Jet tries to assure Katara that he'll be fine, but as they leave, Toph sorrowfully says that Jet was lying. Jet eventually dies from his injuries.</p><p>After they exit the underground base, they finally meet back with Appa. Katara and Toph both want to leave Ba Sing Se, as they have found Appa and thus have no reason to remain there. On the other hand, Sokka wants to stay to inform the Earth King of all that is taking place within Ba Sing Se, as well as the approaching solar eclipse, as this was their entire reason for heading towards Ba Sing Se in the first place. Aang agrees with him. Ultimately, the others agree to do so, and all four ride Appa back to Ba Sing Se's upper ring, and manage to break into the palace, tearing their way through the Royal Guards despite a strong defense.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/7/71/Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png/250px-Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png\" /></a> <a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_vs_Royal_Guard.png/\"><img src=\"http://images.wikia.com/common/releases_200903.3/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png\" alt=\"magnify-clip.png\" /></a></p><p>At the palace, Toph and her friends finally reach the Earth King's throne room, where they are encountered by Long Feng and many Dai Li, who stand before the Earth King as a last defense. Aang goes on to explain the various events going on that the Earth King is unaware of: a war outside Ba Sing Se's walls, Long Feng and the Dai Li's conspiracy, the imprisonment of Appa, and the brainwashing of Jet and countless other individuals. They decide to show the Earth King the outer wall, which was earlier penetrated by the Fire Nation's drill, but the King has had enough, and decides to return to the palace. Sokka quickly convinces him to continue the investigation, however, by letting him ride on Appa.</p><p>The Earth King arrives at the outer wall, and is shocked to see the remains of the Fire Nation's drill leading right up to and through Ba Sing Se's outer wall. Long Feng is then arrested. After the group splits up Toph gets a letter that tells her to meet her mother. She enters an upper-ring building that she finds empty. She goes in, but only suspects trickery at the last minute, and is captured in a metal coffin. Master Yu and Xin Fu emerge from the shadows, and prepare to return Toph to the Bei Fong family so that they may retrieve their reward.</p><h4><b>The Metalbender</b></h4><p>Out on a road, an ostrich-horse is p</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_002.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_002.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/1/1e/Toph_002.png/250px-Toph_002.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_002.png\" /></a></p><p>ulling a cart carrying Master Yu and Xin Fu as well as Toph, who is trapped within a huge metal box. The two up front are arguing about which way to go in order to back to the Bei Fong estate, Toph's home, when Toph yells at the two to stop arguing and let her out to go to the bathroom. Master Yu starts to get up to let her out, but Xin Fu sharply pulls him back from the action, noticing the obvious trick where his companion does not. Toph pounds against the cage she is in, only infuriating Xin Fu more, who tells her that no matter how good an Earthbender she thinks she may be, there is no way that she can bend the metal. Toph continues bashing her hands into the metal walls of her coffin. Her blows send out vibrations, allowing her to sense the fragments of Earth contained within the metal. Toph reaches out for the fragments, and continues stubbornly beating against the coffin, eventually leaving a good-sized dent in the center. She cheers, and congratulates herself for her discovery, before continuing her assault on the coffin's walls.</p><p>Master Yu and Xin Fu are startled by a tearing sound from the back of the wagon, and go to investigate. A massive hole has been ripped in the back of Toph's prison, and she is not inside. Toph emerges further back on the road, and uses Earthbending to thrust Xin Fu and Yu back into the coffin. She then grips each side of the hole she made earlier, and pulls them back together, trapping her captors in her place. After taking a few moments to yell out her triumph and state that she is the greatest Earthbender ever, Toph rapidly heads back to Ba Sing Se by surfing along a self-made wave of Earth. This leaves Xin Fu and Yu locked very uncomfortably within the coffin, and Xin Fu frustrated as ever at having to spend time with his companion while Yu needs to use the bathroom.</p><p>The episode begins with Sokka and Aang both hurrying back to Ba Sing Se on Appa; as they fly along, they spot Toph, who is trying to get back to the Palace as quickly as she can. They pick her up and fly to Ba Sing Se, trying quickly to get there to see if Katara is all right. When asked if he had mastered the Avatar State, Aang lies to the others, saying that he has.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Earth_shield.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Earth_shield.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/5/5c/Earth_shield.png/250px-Earth_shield.png\" alt=\"250px-Earth_shield.png\" /></a></p><p>Outside of the palace, Sokka and Toph soon see General How, but before they can say anything, the Dai Li place him under house arrest. At that very moment, every general is arrested. The two make it into the Throne Room, and they reveal to the Earth King that the girls are not Kyoshi Warriors. Upon seeking Sokka, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47901\" href=\"/ty-lee/4005-47901/\">Ty Lee</a> starts to flirt with him, but he says that he is involved with Suki. Ty Lee does not know who Suki is, which exposes them and Toph throws her to the side with some rocks. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47900\" href=\"/mai/4005-47900/\">Mai</a>, realizing that their identities were exposed, threw a hail of ornate shurikens at Toph, who blocked them with a wall of earth. Ty Lee begins to “fight” Sokka. However, the fighting is in vain, as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47768\" href=\"/princess-azula/4005-47768/\">Azula</a> soon has the King at flame-point. Sokka and Toph give up immediately, and are soon disabled by Ty Lee.</p><p>Later, back in the Palace, Ty Lee is trying to teach Bosco the Bear how to walk on his front legs, but soon she is trapped by Toph. Toph and Sokka take a fighting stance against Mai, who in her nonchalance says to take the bear and the King reunites happily with his pet. After Aang gets wounded, the group (including the Earth King and Bosco) all escape Ba Sing Se on Appa.</p><h3><b>Book 3: Fire</b></h3><h4><b>Into the Fire Nation</b></h4><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_protects_the_ship.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_protects_the_ship.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/7/77/Toph_protects_the_ship.png/250px-Toph_protects_the_ship.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_protects_the_ship.png\" /></a></p><p>Toph and the rest of her friends commandeer a Fire Nation ship, and begin to hide in the waters. Shortly after Aang awakens, they are greeted by another Fire Nation ship. While the others hide, Hakoda and Bato try to talk their way out, but the crew eventually finds holes in their story. The Captain decides to let them think they got away but sinks the ship as soon as they are clear. Toph overhears the order, however, and swiftly drops the captain and his guards into the water by way of Metalbending. Katara then puts space between the two ships with a huge waterbending attack that nearly capsizes the enemy ship, and they try to escape. Despite the tremendous efforts of Katara and Toph, the ship takes heavy damage from the pursuing Fire Nation ship. Out of sheer bad luck, the Serpent of Serpent's Pass appears but is struck by a stray fireball. The heroes get the chance to escape as the enraged serpent attacks the Fire Nation ship. Aang later flees the ship believing that only he can fight the Fire Lord. Toph, Sokka, and Katara split with Hakoda and the others and find Aang on Crescent Island.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_Fire_Nation_clothes.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_Fire_Nation_clothes.png/\"><img src=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/d/d2/Toph_Fire_Nation_clothes.png/250px-Toph_Fire_Nation_clothes.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_Fire_Nation_clothes.png\" /></a></p><p>Toph and the others are traveling through the Fire Nation, using Waterbending to hide Appa in a cloud. They take temporary shelter in a cave, and then go to seek out new clothes to help them better blend into the Fire Nation. They find an unattended clothesline and steal some outfits, and then go to town to buy some accessories. Toph rips out the soles of her new shoes to maintain contact with the ground. After Aang decides to host a dance party for a bunch of Fire Nation students, Toph helps him with the construction (Earthbending).</p><h4><b>The Runaway</b></h4><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph_scamming.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph_scamming.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/1/10/Toph_scamming.png/250px-Toph_scamming.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph_scamming.png\" /></a></p><p>After their money starts to run dangerously low, Toph uses her Earthbending to make money for the group by scamming people off the streets. After winning large amounts because of Toph, who was flaunting her blindness, and seeing the many people being persuaded because of it, Katara begins to think the idea is wrong. Katara objects at the immorality of the idea and argues with Toph over the issue. Toph retorts and calls her a \"motherly\" figure and complains bitterly that Katara is not her, Sokka or Aang's mother. Toph goes on to say how much she hates her own parents.</p><p>Sokka finds a wanted poster for 'The Runaway' (aka Toph). After Sokka reads it aloud, Toph is delighted at the nickname. After hearing how much money is being offered for her return, Toph convinced Sokka to keep the wanted poster a secret by giving him funds for Appa's armor. While going through Toph's possessions, Katara discovers the wanted poster and has an argument with Toph, to which Toph angrily replies that Katara is not her mother and should not tell her what to do. Sokka later talks to Toph to try to mend the rift between her and Katara. As they discuss Katara's motherly instincts, Sokka suggests that he and Toph have a chat about Katara. Toph is not aware that Katara is bathing in the water below them. Toph admitted that Katara cared for her more than her real mother ever did. A touched Katara suggests that she and Toph work together to collect the bounty that Toph has accumulated as the 'ultimate heist'.</p><p>After faking handing her in to the police, it turns out to be a trap set by Combustion Man. Katara and Toph are placed in a wooden prison - a material that neither of them can bend. Combustion Man goes to find Aang to kill him. As Aang and Sokka battle Combustion Man, Katara waterbends her own sweat as a source of water to escape the prison. They race to help Aang, and arrive in the nick of time. Toph accurately hits Combustion Man's tattoo with a stone, which knocks him back. He gets up and attempts to shoot, only to find his chi blocked. Toph realizes she does not hate her parents after all. With Katara acting as a scribe, she writes down a heartfelt message for her parents and it is delivered using Sokka's newly adopted Messenger Hawk, Hawky (without Sokka's permission).</p><h4><b>The Day of Black Sun</b></h4><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:TophDOBSFight.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:TophDOBSFight.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/d/d3/TophDOBSFight.png/250px-TophDOBSFight.png\" alt=\"250px-TophDOBSFight.png\" /></a></p><p>Toph serves as an Earthbending soldier in the Invasion Force during the Invasion of the Fire Nation When the day begins and the invasion force arrives on the island, she is introduced to Tyro and Haru. She also encounters her former enemies, The Big Bad Hippo and The Boulder. At first she prepares to fight them again, until the Boulder tells her that they are fighting for their kingdom now, rather than for others' entertainment. When the invasion force travels in the Water Tribe Submarines, she feels nauseous and throws up in The Duke's helmet. When the battle began, Toph fights alongside the other soldiers, and most especially with The Boulder and the Hippo, against the Fire Nation. She is seen hurling boulders against Fire Nation guard towers.</p><p>Toph joins Sokka behind a wall of tanks while he is commanding the invasion. Soon, they are joined by Hakoda and Katara and shortly after by Aang. Aang tells them that the entire palace city is abandoned and Sokka realizes that they must have known about the invasion. While Aang believes that the Fire Lord must be away on a remote island, Sokka reasons that he would have a secret bunker underneath the city where he can still be close enough to lead his nation. Toph volunteers to find this bunker, and goes off with Sokka and Aang to the base of the volcano.</p><p>She uses her ability to feel into earth with vibrations to locate the outer wall of the bunker, then uses Earth and Metalbending to open a hole for them. She leads them inside, and takes them in the right direction, saying that the other way was a dead end. She continues to lead them through the bunker, until they reach a river of lava, which Aang flies them over. They reach a large metal door, which Toph easily breaks through, prompting Sokka to say he was \"so glad they made her a part of the group\". Eventually, the encounter War Minister Qin, who quickly tells them where the Fire Lord's throne room is. Just as the eclipse begins, they reach the outer entrance of the throne room, which Aang breaks through, and they find Azula sitting on the throne.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:DOBS_meele.JPG\" href=\"/wiki/Image:DOBS_meele.JPG/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/b/be/DOBS_meele.JPG/250px-DOBS_meele.JPG\" alt=\"250px-DOBS_meele.JPG\" /></a></p><p>Azula taunts them until the group begins questioning her about her father's whereabouts. Toph warns her that she'll be able to tell if she's lying, until Azula successfully fools her senses. Toph admits she is good, but encases her body in stone and warns her to tell the truth anyway. However, the stone mysteriously breaks apart. The group is shocked for a moment, before Azula reveals that she brought back two Dai Li agents from Ba Sing Se. A furious battle ensues. Aang and Toph fight the Dai Li agents while trying to corner Azula. Eventually, both Agents become trapped while Aang and Toph chase after Azula. Sokka realizes that Azula is trying to keep the group here and waste their eclipse time. After a furious confrontation during which Azula goads Sokka into furiously questioning her for a minute, she regains her Firebending and escapes. Aang wants to fight the Fire Lord anyway, but Sokka and Toph agree to leave. They quickly escape the bunker.</p><p>Outside, Toph quickly joins the Invasion Force's escape, until they are cut off when the Fire Nation Airships destroy the submarines. While the bulk of the Invasion Force is captured, Toph, the gang and Teo, Haru and the Duke escape, to the Western Air Temple. (\" The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse\")</p><h4><b>The Western Air Temple</b></h4><p>After the invasion, the group dejectedly makes its way to the Western Air Temple. When they cross into the edge of a canyon, Toph excitedly announces that they've made it. While only Aang seems to know what she's talking about, Toph says that the Temple is amazing. They find that the Temple is carved upside-down out of the canyon.</p><p>While Teo, The Duke, and Haru set out to explore the temple, Toph, Sokka, Katara and Aang decide to talk about their future plans, though Aang seems reluctant. They discuss Aang finding a Firebending teacher, but are unable to come up with any viable people. Aang runs off to play in the temple, while the others follow him. They land next to a large fountain, while Aang tries to show them different parts of the Temple, Toph announces that that will have to wait. She points out that Zuko has joined them.</p><p>Zuko tells the others that he's changed and he wishes to join their group to teach Aang Firebending. While the others immediately shoot Zuko down and refuse him, Toph stays mostly silent and thoughtful. After Zuko leaves, the others angrily talk against him. When Katara calls Zuko a liar, Toph tells them that he wasn't lying and that the entire time he was sincere. While the others continue to act angry, Toph recommends that they at least consider Zuko as a possibility. However, Aang, Katara and Sokka all flatly refuse, and Toph storms off.</p><p>Later that night, Toph finds Zuko's campsite, and approaches him. However, Zuko is only just waking up and is startled by Toph's sudden appearance, and Firebends at her. Toph tries to shield herself from the fire, but she steps back while the fire is spreading, and it burns her feet. When Zuko realizes what has happened, he tries to help her, but she panics and tries to get away. While Zuko keeps trying to explain that it was a mistake, Toph pushes him back with Earthbending and leaves.</p><p>The next day, Toph rejoins the group unable to walk because of her burned feet. While Katara attempts to heal her, Toph explains that she went to see Zuko last night and he burned her feet. While the others immediately suggest attacking Zuko, Toph tries to tell them that it was an accident and that they should just invite him back as a prisoner.</p><p>Just then, they are attacked by Combustion Man. Zuko intervenes and tries to get Combustion Man to stop his attack, but the assassin ignores him and even attacks him. Eventually, Combustion Man is taken out by Sokka's boomerang and the gang meets Zuko again. When Zuko explains himself more fully, Toph is the first to forgive him and jokingly says that now she has plenty of time to pay him back for her feet.</p><p>Toph seems to be more comfortable around Zuko than the others are. Once, she helpfully suggests Zuko try to find the original source of Firebending in order to regain his powers. (\" The Firebending Masters.)</p><p>When the Fire Nation attacks the Western Air Temple, Toph's Earthbending proves essential in saving her friends and allies as they escape through the ruins. (\" The Southern Raiders\")</p><h4><b>The Ember Island Players</b></h4><p>Toph would accompany her group to a play about themselves being shown on Ember Island. She takes great pleasure at teasing her friends about how \"accurate\" their portrayals on stage are, when in reality the portrayals make them all look bad. Toph is inaccurately portrayed by a large man who claims to see by letting out a \"sonic wave\" through the mouth. Toph, however, is thrilled at her tough guy image. During the play's intermission, Toph talks to Zuko about Zuko's uncle, who Zuko was reminded of by the play. He remembered how he betrayed him and how ashamed he was at his actions. Toph comforted Zuko by telling him how Iroh told her about him and that he had faith that Zuko would find his way. In this way, Toph bonded with Zuko as the other characters had since his defection, she demonstrates her affection by punching him, much like she does with other characters.</p><p>Ironically, when the play ends, Toph agrees with her group that it was a terrible show. This could be due to its unpleasant ending. (\" The Ember Island Players\")</p><h4><b>Sozin's Comet</b><br /><br /><b>Prelude</b></h4><p>Prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Toph and her friends have a beach party on Ember Island, where she instantaneously sandbends a miniature model of Ba Sing Se. The party is interrupted by Zuko when he informs the group of Ozai's plot to destroy the Earth Kingdom with the comet. As the group drills for their final assault, Toph plays as the Melon Lord and really gets into her role, nearly hitting Sokka with her Earthbending (\"Watch it Toph!\" \"I am not Toph, I am Melon Lord! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha\"). When Aang disappears, Toph eagerly joins Zuko in his search for Aang, as it was her turn for a \"life changing field trip\" with him. However, when she starts talking about her family issues, Zuko curtly shuts her down.</p><p>Toph travels with the gang to Ba Sing Se to launch an attack on the Fire Lord's Airship Fleet alongside Suki and Sokka, and participates in the Battle at Wulong Forest. She commandeers one of the Airships by bending a large metal door into a suit of armor, easily overwhelming the crew. The trio uses the Airship to ram into the rest of the ships, but Suki is separated in the process. With Suki telling them to complete the mission, Toph feels the Airship Part, they are on, falling and warns Sokka that maybe they should jump, knowing that Suki can make it. Then, after jumping onto another Airship, with Sokka helping her, Toph forces the Airships to crash into each other by bending their rudders, causing Sokka to say how great it was she invented metalbending (Sokka: Did I ever mention how sweet it was that you invented metalbending? Toph: You could stand to mention it more). A Fire Nation soldier comes out so see why the change of course and discovers them. The soldier shoots a giant fire blast at them, causing them to slip off the vessel while trying to avoid the fire. Sokka uses his sword to slow their fall, only partially succeding and get an injured leg in the process. He grabs ahold of Toph's Hand as she falls overboard and manages to hold her while fighting off two fire nation guards, Toph slips more and more each second, and just as Toph's only hanging by a few fingers, Suki comes in with an airship and saves the two. The battle ends in a total victory for the trio as all of the Airships are destroyed.</p><h4><b>Post War</b></h4><p>After Zuko is crowned Fire Lord and the War ends, Toph joins the gang at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where they celebrate their victory. When everyone is complaining about Sokka's drawing she jokingly says that she thinks they all look great causing everyone to laugh, which is ironic because Toph can not see what they look like.</p><p>It's unknown if Toph ever goes back to her parents' house.</p><h2>After the Series</h2><p>Toph would go on to travel the Earth Kingdom and recruit earthbenders for her academy to teach them metalbending. Once Aang and Zuko had setup Republic City Toph would go on to become the chief of police and have her metal benders trained as the police force, She would serve dutifully for years and a statue of her was erected in front of the police headquarters in her honor. Toph would have a daughter Lin Beifong would would also become the chief of police for Republic City.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong></p><p>When first introduced, Toph brought a totally new personality to the group. Unlike the nurturing Katara, flighty Aang or gruff but goofy Sokka, Toph is fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, brutally frank, and confrontational. She appears to have the same carefree and adventurous personality as Aang, and she is very tomboyish in the way she acts and dresses - a contrast to the delicate doll her parents see her as. However, unlike Aang, who avoids fighting whenever possible, Toph loves battling and takes great pride in her Earthbending skills. She appears eager to prove that she is as strong as anyone who can see.</p><p>Toph's eagerness to prove that she can be independent has led to some initial difficulties with Aang and his friends. Toph insists that she can \"carry her own weight\", and often mistakes a simple friendly gesture as an act of pity for her blindness. Her encounter with Iroh, however, has taught her that Aang, Katara, and Sokka care for her because they are friends, not because her disability makes them feel obligated to do so.</p><p>Toph is brutally honest when criticizing others. She is vocal about her opinions on others regardless of status (the Avatar, Aang, or age (Iroh). Her occasional spoiled attitude or aloofness may be related to her being the only child of one of the richest families in the Earth Kingdom. Thanks to her time as a competitor and champion of the Earthbending tournaments (in \" The Blind Bandit ), she is an expert in verbally taunting and insulting her opponents, and on occasion her friends (particularly non-bender Sokka). She reveals to Katara that, being unable to see what she looks like, she doesn't feel the need to fuss over her appearance. However, despite her many quirks, Toph has shown that she is a quick learner, and her courage and loyalty to her new friends seems very stable.</p><p>Toph and Katara seem to be polar opposites; while Katara is kind, welcoming, and supportive, Toph is tough, unyielding, and steadfast. This extends to their teaching styles to Aang. However, Toph eventually shows a bit of compromise to help Aang through his initial difficulty with Earthbending. Despite occasional clashes or spats Toph and Katara generally get along, perhaps if only for the fact that they are both girls.</p><p>One of Toph's most obvious traits involves personal hygiene. She is accustomed to lying on the ground, and walking everywhere barefoot leaving her soles quite soiled. This is common, however, as most Earthbenders in the show walk barefoot, likely so that their body is directly touching the earth at all times. Also, she has been seen belching loudly, picking her nose, spitting, and is usually covered in dirt or, as she calls it, \"a healthy coating of earth.\"</p><p>Toph is well-educated in the manners and bearings of high society--she merely consciously and consistently chooses to ignore them. She makes an exception in one episode (\" City of Walls and Secrets\"), when the group needs to go to a special party to see the Earth King, in order to give news of the solar eclipse, only to meet the head of the Dai Li, Long Feng.</p><p>An ongoing joke concerning Toph's blindness is her lack of ability to discern anything that has been written or drawn. In \" Lake Laogai\", Toph becomes angry when Sokka suggests that she needs help putting up flyers. She spitefully puts up a poster, only to inadvertently place it backwards and remarking, \"It's upside-down, isn't it?\" Also in the episode, she compliments Sokka on his drawings of Appa despite the obvious fact that she cannot see them. Finally, in \" The Runaway\", after being presented with the same poster twice, Toph vocally expresses her annoyance with the constant oversight.</p><p>In \" Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into The Inferno\", Toph mistakes Sokka's comment about taking the wheel thinking he was referring to her. By the smile on her face she was gleeful about getting another chance to correct him. But it turns out that Sokka was talking to Suki, and she manages to cover up her intention pretty well. At the end of Sozin's Comet she makes a joke about Sokka's drawing that she thinks everyone looks great.</p><p>As shown in \" The Chase\", Toph gets extremely irritable with lack of sleep.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3><b>Earthbending</b></h3><p>Toph is a very powerful Earthbender, despite her blindness. Her bending abilities are drastically potent.</p><p>Although blind, Toph has the unique ability to use Earthbending to \"feel\" even the most minute vibrations in the earth, including the march of ants several meters away and the presence of trees and buildings. Through this heightened seismic sense, she can visualize where people are, their relative distance to her, and their physical build, but she cannot visualize faces, as stated in \" The Tales of Ba Sing Se. This sense provides her with a distinct advantage when facing other Earthbenders in combat. Because she can predict attacks as they begin and quickly react, her speed and agility are also greatly beneficial.</p><p>However, because Toph is dependent on vibrations in the earth, she is vulnerable to air-based attacks, as shown in her fight with Aang in \" The Blind Bandit\". At the end of the same episode, Toph is completely surprised by Sokka dropping a large belt on her head. Her success rate in intercepting projectiles is also tied to her sensing of vibrations, being able to feel an opponent's movement and proceed accordingly. By her own admission in \" The Desert\", she can't feel her own projectiles while they are airborne.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Column.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Column.png/\"><img src=\"http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/5/5e/Column.png/250px-Column.png\" alt=\"250px-Column.png\" /></a></p><p>Terrain that impairs Toph's ability to sense vibrations also hinders her abilities, as shown in the episodes \" The Library\" and \" The Desert\", Toph has some difficulty with sand, describing the vibrations in the earth as \"fuzzy.\" She is able to compress sand into solid rock to gain some temporary footing, but is still unable to accurately aim attacks under those conditions. Toph also expresses an aversion for flying, as she she can't sense her surroundings without her feet on solid ground.</p><p>Also as a result of her closeness or affinity with earth, Toph can rest or sleep comfortably on solid rock without any sleeping bag or blanket and can walk on any kind of terrain in bare feet, a standard trait for Earthbenders. Toph relies on direct contact between her feet and the ground for \"sight\" as well as for her Earthbending. Toph is very reluctant to allow anyone to touch her feet, probably because insensitive handling there would make her deaf to other vibrations and thereby render her helpless. She touches them regularly, however, to groom them and keep them clear of debris for better contact with the ground.</p><p>Despite her substantial prowess on land, Toph does not perform well in water and on ice. She is not able to swim, and became nauseous when she needed to travel by submarine in \"The Day of Black Sun\".</p><p>Toph has a great sense of hearing and can recognize people by the sound of their voices. In \" The Desert\", Toph recognizes the Sandbender who stole Appa, adding that that she never forgets a voice. In \" City of Walls and Secrets\", Toph is seen feeling even slight vibrations as she tells a man they meet \"I can feel you shaking.\" In the episode \" Lake Laogai\", Toph demonstrated an ability to sense when a person is lying by the vibrations of his/her heartbeat and breathing patterns. However, Toph's senses are not absolute, as Azula demonstrates that she is easily able to lie without even the slightest physical reaction.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:Toph-s3.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:Toph-s3.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/b/bd/Toph-s3.png/250px-Toph-s3.png\" alt=\"250px-Toph-s3.png\" /></a></p><p>Toph's Earthbending style is based on Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis Kung Fu, which is a style that is apparently unique to her; the style of Earthbending used by other Earthbenders is rooted in the Hung Gar style of Kung Fu. She is the only bender on the show known to use a style based on a different root martial art than the standard for their bending art. This may be because she is self-taught rather than trained in the traditional Earthbending form. According to creator commentary, Toph came to develop her unique style by observing the movements of the similarly blind Earthbending Badgermoles that can be found around her hometown. In \" Sokka's Master\", Toph herself mentions that she was taught by these creatures.</p><p>In the episode \" Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King\", Toph reveals that she has been working on her Sandbending, and is now good enough at it to create a miniature version of the upper ring of Ba Sing Se in rich detail. Her ability to sense vibrations in it is not mentioned.</p><h4><b>Metalbending</b></h4><p><a data-ref-id=\"Image:TophMetal.png\" href=\"/wiki/Image:TophMetal.png/\"><img src=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/thumb/8/8e/TophMetal.png/250px-TophMetal.png\" alt=\"250px-TophMetal.png\" /></a></p><p>As of the episode \" The Guru\", Toph is the first and only known character with the ability to bend metal. Metal is derived from ore, which is found in the earth. In the episode, while Toph is seen concentrating in her iron prison, Guru Pathik explains to Aang in a parallel scene that \"Metal is just a part of Earth that has been purified and refined.\" Because of Toph's ability to feel the vibrations in earth, she is able to locate the impurities (the small fragments of earth) in metal and manipulate them to \"bend\" the metal portion. As of the end of Book Two, Toph is the only known Earthbender with the ability to bend metal.</p><p>In \" Sokka's Master\", Sokka gives Toph a small piece of meteorite, which being composed of earth and metal, she can easily mold into a myriad of shapes, and subsequently transforms it into an arm bracelet she now wears. Aside from these abilities, Toph has shown herself to be one of the most powerful Earthbenders in the series, being the only known Earthbender to ever bend metal, a feat that even the Avatar has been unable to perform since the origin of Earthbending.</p><p>In the episode \" Sozin's Comet, Part 3: Into the Inferno\" when she was breaking into a Fire Nation Airship, it is shown that her Metalbending has improved greatly as she makes metal armor and manipulates the metallic structure of the room with far more ease than before, moving metal more fluidly. She is also able to crawl hanging on to the metal ceiling while completely covered in metal.</p><p>For more information on Earthbending, visit the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-52146\" href=\"/benders/4015-52146/\">Benders</a> page.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><p>The Boulder: Earth Bending Wrestler: The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young, blind girl.</p><p>Toph: Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder!</p><p>[pause]</p><p>The Boulder: Earth Bending Wrestler: The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you in a rock-a-lanche!</p><p>Toph: Whenever you're ready- The Pebble!</p><p>Toph: You guys get to go wherever you want, no one telling you what to do...

    "deck": "Sokka is a teenage warrior from the South Pole's Southern Water Tribe who discovered Aang, the new Avatar, along with his sister Katara. He travels with them on a quest to defeat the Fire Nation. He is sarcastic and loves meat.",
    "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>Sokka grew up in a <a href=\"/water-tribe/4060-48046/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48046\">Water Tribe</a> village near the South Pole. Tragedy struck his family when his mother was killed in a <a href=\"/fire-nation/4060-48047/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48047\">Fire Nation</a> attack. As he grew up Sokka developed his warrior skills while his sister <a href=\"/katara/4005-25622/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25622\">Katara </a>practiced Waterbending. When his father and the other warriors from the village left to fight with the <a href=\"/earth-kingdom/4060-48048/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48048\">Earth Kingdom</a> against the Fire Nation, Sokka and his sister were left to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran.</p><p> </p><p>While on a spearfishing trip, Sokka and his sister found <a href=\"/aang/4005-47646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47646\">Aang</a>, the last member of the <a href=\"/air-nomads/4060-48049/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48049\">Air Nomads</a>, frozen in suspended animation in an iceberg. Katara freed him but Sokka initially considered Aang to be a spy from the Fire Nation. Once he realized that Aang was actually the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka joined him and Katara on a journey to find a waterbending instructor for Aang at the North Pole.</p><p> </p><p>Later on they gain a new member of the gang, <a href=\"/toph/4005-47732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47732\">Toph</a>. When they visit the Earth Kingdom because Aang needs an Earthbending teacher they go to an underground Tournament. Toph is the winner even though she is blind but she can \"see\" with the earth. Aang asks for her help to learn Earthbending. She accepts but she must sneak away from her parents in order to do so.</p><p> </p><p>So after meeting Toph, the gang decides to go on vacation, and while deciding, Sokka and Katara were having an argument over whose turn it was. So they just decided to finally let Aang choose. He chose a spot in the desert where there was a giant iceberg that tourists were attracted to see that supplied that town with water everyday for years, and many more to come. But upon arrival they see that the so called,\"wonderous and spectacular burg\",had actually been melting for 100yrs.,and Aang thought it was still there, but he did not know considering he went into the Avatar state and froze the lake he was in.After going into a local bar to buy some cold drinks, they met a very skilled Mapper, who had lead many expeditions into the desert and back. So Katara thought that since he had lead so many trips, that he would know where what they were looking for was! It turned out that he did not know, and that they had a small chance of finding the spirits library.</p><p> </p><p>So on the way there they ran into two giant problems, dehydration, and starvation. Katara was running out of her waterbending water to fight with, because she kept giving chunks by chunks of water to her teammates. The next day Sokka found a cactus, and sliced it open with his sword knowing that there would be water. but the water was strange, he was acting very abnormal, and after Aang had gotten frustrated in an attempt to gather a nearby cloud into water using his skills. Yet when Aang threw a fit and used his air powers to make a giant cloud of dust miles away, Sokka thought it was a giant mushroom, and started to wave and say,\"Hey Mr. Mushroom!!\". So after the theory of walking by night to avoid the sun's drenching heat succeeded, they reached a giant hornets' nest. They wondered into a tunnel of the large rock formation to shade themselves(considering they had walked all night and into nearly 12:00pm of the day)Sokka found some gooey like substance and actually ate some of it, then after disgusting out Katara, he found that the cactus juice had not completely worn off. But they heard a buzzing sound, and then Toph felt something coming from within the tunnels, so as the team runs out, a herd of giant wasps follows them out. As they fight, Aang flies on his glider to hurt them, and since Toph is blind, Katara tells her where to shoot blocks of rock. But considering the juice, Sokka was slashing at nothing but air. After most were dead, one of them grabbed Momo, he thrusts a giant blast of wind killing the wasp.</p><p> </p><p>When they reach the library, Sokka looks at the map,\"I only see the triangle thingy\" he said looking continuously back and forth for the map to the structure. Then Katara realized, it was underground! Yet, then they saw a strange leopard looking figure come out of the tower top, and the shape was able to run down walls! It gave a gesture to come up to the tower and into the library, so they followed. But Toph refused to go in, she said that there was no earth in there, and that she WOULD be really blind, so she stayed out with Appa. But when the others went in, they saw the most extraordinary structure they had ever seen! But in the middle of all that, the spirit came and made the gang offer something to put into the library. Katara gave a Southern waterbending book, Aang gave a picture album, and Sokka gave a...piece of string.So the spirit let them roam free, but the only rule was that they could not use any of the information in the library to hurt other enemies. So they roamed, but then they stumbled across a planetarium. They were fascinated at the planetariums abilities, they could make it so that it were night, or day. So after leaving the planetarium, the spirit came, and said that he was going to punish them for trying to find the date for a Lunar Eclipse, and that he was taking his library back to the mirror world, where they would come if still there. So as the library sank, Aang and Sokka ran back to the planetarium to use the date to see if it the date on the piece of paper was the date of the next Lunar Eclipse.</p><p> </p><p>During their adventures Sokka wants to become more useful when he can do nothing to extinguish a fire caused by a meteor. He decides to visit the Fire Nation sword master. Though he felt unworthy, Piando trains Sokka. Because of Sokka's creativity and ability to \"think outside the box\", his master says he can create a sword. He uses the meteoroid that caused the fire. When finished the sword came out black. During the ceremony where Piando gives him the sword Sokka tells him that he is from the Southern Water Tribe. The two then duel. When Sokka is about to be defeated Piando lets down his sword. He told him and the gang that he knew from the start he was from a Water Tribe and notes that Aang is the Avatar. He claims the art of the sword does not belong to any one nation and gives him his sword back. As they leave Piando gives Sokka a White Lotus Pai Sho tile, saying that it is something to \"remember him by\". Sokka then gives Toph a piece of the space rock that was left.</p><p> </p><p>Later when in they're in the woods Sokka tries to tell a scary story. Unfortunately he gets beaten by Katara who tells one about her mom's friend. They were then surprised when an old woman named Hama suddenly shows. She lets them stay in her home since people said there was a spirit taking people. When Hama isn't home The Gaang go sneaking around her house. They find a locked door which Toph metalbends open. The gang find a box which they can't open. Hama then appears and opens it. Revealing a comb from the Southern Water Tribe. Hama was a waterbender captured by the Fire Nation. One night while Katara is training with Hama Aang Sokka and Toph go investigate a hill here Toph heard screams.</p><p> </p><p>They find chained people in a cave who reveal that the spirit is actually Hama who controlled them. hey leave Toph to unlock the people while Aang and Sokka tell Katara. When there they find the two in a duel. Hama then bloodbends them to attack Katara with his sword. Katara attaches them to different trees with ice but Hama breaks them free and brings them together with Sokka's sword getting ready to attack Aang. Katara stops them in time and bloodbends Hama into defeat. When Hama is arrested she says that her work is done by making Katara use bloodbending. Katara then weeps and Sokka and Aang goes to comfort her.</p><p> </p><p>The gang decide take a rest four days before the Day of the Black Sun and Aang starts to stress about facing Firelord Ozai. For two days Aang has nightmares about facing the Firelord. After Katara tries to help him relax Sokka tries by talking to him like a guidance counselor in a field of koala sheep. His attempt fails along with Toph's. Later Aang decides not to go to sleep. This causes him to have daydreams. Katara, Sokka, and Toph make him a wool bed and Aang finally relaxes.</p><h2>Legend of Korra Series</h2><p>Sokka eventually became both the Southern Water Tribe's chief as well as a council member for Republic City. He outlived his good friend Aang and was their to defend a child Korra from a kidnapping attempt by the Red Lotus Society. Sokka passed away soon after though his legacy lives on as one of Republic City's founders. There is a statue of him in front of the Southern Water Tribe cultural center.</p><p> </p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>As the only non-bender of the group, Sokka is often over shadowed by the others. But usually, he is the one to make a plan and is well known for his sense of humor which is shown to hold the group together in times of need during the War.</p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>Sokka is very intelligent and is known for his strategical mind and ingenuity on and off battle. Sokka's skills in strategical planning has led to him being considered Team Avatar's official idea guy and would make important traveling and martial decisions.</p><p>During his time at the Library, Sokka was the one who figured out Firebenders lose their power during a Solar eclipse and developed a plan to take adavantage of their weakness in the Day of the Black Sun. His tactical thinking was also utilized in his formal duel against Piandao where Sokka held his own through cunning tactics like throwing sand in his master's eyes, and utilizing the environment to his advantage. On the day of Sozin's Comet, Sokka was able to creatively come up with a successful plan to destroy several Fire Nation airships on the spot.</p><p>His intelligence has also been shown to include a natural talent for science and leadership. Even in his more humble days, Sokka was an engineering genius smart enough to figure out how a hot air balloon functions which was technologically advanced for the Avatar world.</p><p>While initially inexperienced, Sokka would gradually grew into a proficient leader and an essential member of Team Avatar.</p><h3>Peak Human Agility</h3><p>Often highly underestimated as a non bender, Sokka has still shown impressive reflexes and agility against benders and skilled opponents including Piandao, Zuko, Mai, Ty Lee, and Fire Nation Soliders.</p><p>In the Day of the Black Sun, Sokka was agile enough to jump on the head off a charging rhino, cut off a wooden spear, and steal a ride from a Fire Nation Solider all while keeping momentum.</p><h3>Boomerang Skills</h3><p>Sokka is a highly accurate marksmen through his signature weapon of a trusty boomerang which has the unique ability to always return to it's owner even after striking any target from any distance.</p><p>His skill most notably played a vital role in the defeat of the powerful Combustion Man. Sokka managed to get a direct hit from his target from hundreds of feet away and hundred's of feet high all from estimating an angle from his blasts while Sokka couldn't even see him. This resourceful instance blocked the chi in Combustion Man's third eye which eventually led to his death.</p><h3>Swordsmanship</h3><p>Sokka was trained in the art of swordsmanship from the highly proficient non bender Master Piandao who is a member of the secret White Lotus group and said to be skilled enough to defeat 100 Fire Nation soliders single handedly in the past.</p><p>With 2 days worth of training, Sokka became a proficient swordsman with his unique Jian blade forged from a black meteorite.</p><p>His Jian sword (affectionally nicknamed Space Sword) has been shown to be unusually strong in striking strength and has been effortlessly able to slice boulders, steel turrets, and even a steel platform while thrown with one hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword was sacrificed on the Day of Sozin's Comet when thrown overboard a Fire Nation airship to save Toph and himself from a Boosted Firebender.</p><p> </p>",

The extra dimensional being Dreamslayer invited Meanstreak into the New Extremists in order to bring an end to the JLA, a challenge they failed to achieve. Later, Dreamslayer seized a device operated by the Colorado cult, \"Flock of the Machine\" (who worshipped the all powerful Overmaster) to provide a second chance at glory for Meanstreak and her comrades. After they again fell short, the Overmaster drew the New Extremists into his Cadre, an army of super villains. Despit its size, the Cadre foundered, but Meanstreak and her fellow New Extremists are still active as mobile mercenaries.",

The King's name should be Olaf (Somebody)son, and his son would be Ewald Olafson.",

    "description": "<p>Gordy is an agent of  S.M.I.L.E (Special Military Intelligence Law Enforcement), an American federal agency with vague connections to the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55745\" href=\"/cia/4060-55745/\" slug=\"cia\">          CIA</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55443\" href=\"/fbi/4060-55443/\" slug=\"fbi\">         FBI</a>. He first contacted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\" href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" slug=\"luke-cage\">        Luke Cage</a> to have him locate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62059\" href=\"/sally-mcrae/4005-62059/\" slug=\"sally-mcrae\">       Sally McRae</a>, the young daughter of a Pentagon employee. She had recently run away from home, accidentally taking with her a notebook including access codes to the Pentagon computers. He threatened Cage with being able to shut down <a data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\" href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" slug=\"heroes-for-hire\">      Heroes For Hire</a> in case of failure. Since the girl destroyed the notebook rather than have it stolen by enemy agents, the mission was a success for S.M.I.L.E.  <br/> <br/>He later had Luke Cage and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\" href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" slug=\"iron-fist\">     Iron Fist</a> manipulated into fighting Control 7, an enemy organization, ... for free. He had various agents keep surveillance on his two reluctant allies. This backfired when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1494\" href=\"/colleen-wing/4005-1494/\" slug=\"colleen-wing\">    Colleen Wing</a> mistook them for genuine threats and almost killed them. Cage had to explain they were just \"nosy\".  <br/> <br/>Gordy was at a later point investigating the latest activities of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14525\" href=\"/yellow-claw/4005-14525/\" slug=\"yellow-claw\">   Yellow Claw</a> when Cage demanded help. Iron Fist was undergoing personality changes and needed direction. Gordy had to masquerade as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21916\" href=\"/yu-ti/4005-21916/\" slug=\"yu-ti\">  Yu-Ti</a> in order to provide said direction. He also disguised himself as Power Man to attract the fire of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10296\" href=\"/lumus/4005-10296/\" slug=\"lumus\"> John Lumus</a>. A direct shot by Lumus' bazooka failed to penetrate Gordy's force field. He was then able to deactivate the armor of his opponent.  <br/> <br/>Gordy was last seen participating in the interrogation of Cage, suspected of murdering Iron Fist. Cage escaped custody and Gordy promised to have S.M.I.L.E. locate him. The storyline was dropped.   <br/> <br/>Gordy was equipped with a cellular phone equipped with advanced weaponry. It could generate a force field strong enough to survive bazooka fire. It could short out electronic devices in Gordy's vicinity.He has also been seen using it as a boomerang. <br/> <br/><br/></p><p>  <br/></p><p><br/> </p><br/><br/><p> </p>",

    "deck": "Squall is the lead character in Final Fantasy VIII. He is a member of Balamb Garden, an elite military school that trains youths to become mercenaries, and also one of Sora's allies.",
    "description": "<i><b><u> <h2>Introduction</h2> </u></b></i>Squall Leonhart is a popular character from the Final Fantasy video game series who starred in Final Fantasy VIII (8) with characters like Rinoa Heartily, Zell Dincht, and Seifer Almasy. He was also in the popular Kingdom Hearts series as a nonplayable character and popular boss fight, albeit being one of the main allies of Sora, the protagonist of the game. Throughout his journeys he became far more mature in FFVIII, and the more matured, calmer and cooler Squall is who we see in Kingdom Hearts, not the troubled teen that was played in the original game at all. All in all, Squall Leonhart has appeared in books, games, and multiple other media, but he is only here because he is a character from the Kingdom Hearts manga. <p><br/></p> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/255829-66162-squall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-255829\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/255829-66162-squall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-255829\"><img alt=\"Enjoy\" src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/255829-66162-squall.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4439/255829-66162-squall.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Enjoy</figcaption></figure> <br/> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i><br/></i></b></u></p> <p><u><b><i>Kingdom Hearts</i></b></u></p><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/48000/47742/66162-squall_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/48000/47742/66162-squall_150.jpg\"/></a><br/><b>The Final Fantasy take on Squall... </b><br/><br/><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/48000/47742/113553-squall_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/48000/47742/113553-squall_150.jpg\"/></a><br/><b>and the Kingdom Hearts take on Squall </b><br/><br/> <p><br/>Leon first appeared as a manga character in the Kingdom Hearts One manga volume. as a mysterious man in Traverse Town after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44471\" href=\"/sora/4005-44471/\" slug=\"sora\">Sora</a> mysteriously appeared. And, seeing that this young man had the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-46214\" href=\"/keyblade/4055-46214/\" slug=\"keyblade\">Keyblade</a>, the weapon he had been looking for since he'd been forced to abandon Radiant Garden, his hometown. He challenged the young boy to a duel, and defeated him promptly. A woman walked up to him, telling him that maybe he'd just been a little rusty and didn't know how to fight and hold back. She called him \"Squall\", something he'd let go of a long time ago. He told <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45227\" href=\"/aerith/4005-45227/\" slug=\"aerith\">Aerith</a> not to call him by that name, and she didn't, just sighed. </p><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/44471/45967-sora_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/44471/45967-sora_150.jpg\"/></a><br/><b>The little kid in the alleyway, who just so happened to have a legendary weapon</b> <br/><br/>They took the kid back to their place (a hotel deeper into <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54099\" href=\"/traverse-town/4020-54099/\" slug=\"traverse-town\">Traverse Town</a>, filled with more heartless, though they were able to contain them better in the heart of the city), and waited for him to wake up again. While he lay, Leon attempted to use his Keyblade, only to have it simply dissaparate right back to Sora each and every time. After seeing that this was how it worked, the young boy woke up and saw his weapon come right back to him. Leon explained that the weapon had chosen him, and that Heartless would keep attacking him until he was dead because he had it, the most effective way of killing heartless, so they were naturally extremely scared of it, and, due to the fact that it was the only thing that their master could be defeated by, they were sent out to retrieve it and seal the Keyholes in every world until all of them were overrun with heartless. He was introduced to Sora by Aerith and Yuffie as Leon, and the young boy looked onward at him like he was a role model. After a sudden heartless attack, the two warriors jumped out of the building, and Leon told Sora that the main half of town would be taken care of by him, and the fight was on. After Leon cleared out the town he would find that Sora had actually had the more dangerous part of the job and would apologize to him for not sensing that he should have done the best he could when sensing their presence. Sora had also apparebtly met up with some new partners, the kings men, in fact, that were intent on getting him back to King Mickey as soon as possible, and so, for his parting gift, Leon and his friends gave them some money to live off of for a little while while they still were in a bad financial state, and let them be off.",

Sonic grew up with his Uncle Chuck, and they developed a father-son relationship. When Uncle Chuck was roboticized, Sonic was devastated.

    "description": "<h2>History</h2><br/>West attended school with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47664\" href=\"/claire-bennet/4005-47664/\" slug=\"claire-bennet\"> Claire Bennet</a> in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\" href=\"/california/4020-55716/\" slug=\"california\"> California</a>.  At first she accused him of spying on her, but soon discovered that he knew her secret.  He had seen her super human abilities, and admitted that he was an evolved human with the ability of flight. <br/> <br/>The two began dating.  One day at the beach, the two were kissing when Claire suddently noticed marks on his neck.  West confessed that when he was 10 years old, a mysterious man abducted him.  When he woke up he didn't remember what happened during his abduction, or why he had the two marks on his neck.  When Claire asked who was the man, he only recalled 'a man with horned rimmed glasses'.  Claire from that moment began to be suspicious on her father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47669\" href=\"/hrg/4005-47669/\" slug=\"hrg\"> Noah Bennet</a>. <br/>   <br/>When Claire wanted to became a cheerlader again in the Costa Verde High School, West gave her an idea how to humiliate the cheer captain, thus helping her back onto the squad.  He took a mask to disguise himself and flew high up while carrying Claire.  With the cheer captain watching, he dropped Claire, seemingly killing her.  When the police arrived, they found the alcohol the cheer captain kept hidden.  With her drinking exposed, she was expelled.  Therefore Claire was able to take over her former place.  <br/><br/>Claire once more began her cheerleading career, which took her away from West.  The things became complicated when Noah have found a series of eight paintings painted by deceased <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47670\" href=\"/isaac-mendez/4005-47670/\" slug=\"isaac-mendez\"> Isaac Mendez</a>.  The series of paintings began with the death of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47672\" href=\"/kaito-nakamura/4005-47672/\" slug=\"kaito-nakamura\"> Kaito Nakamura </a>and ended with Noah Bennet's death as Claire, and a mystery figure kissing in the background.  When confronted with this discovery, Claire denied that she'd been dating anyone.  So Noah didn't stop doubting he gave up spying on her daughter.  Unknown at first to Claire,one morning when she woke up, West was in her home cooking waffles with Sandra Bennet.  Claire tried to tell West about her father when Noah arrived home and West flew away seemingly having broken up with her.  <br/><br/>Claire confessed to Noah about her relationship with West and Noah decided that it's time to move on again.  Claire ran away from home and went to apologise to West, who still wasn't sure about their relationship.  She told that her parent were moving away again, but she was staying because she loved him.  The next morning Noah was attacked by West.  He thought that Claire worked for Noah to spy on him, but he decided to help Noah because he thought that Claire was in danger.   <br/> <br/>So <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49331\" href=\"/robert-bishop/4005-49331/\" slug=\"robert-bishop\"> Bob Bishop</a> kidnapped Claire in order to maintain blood sample from her as a cure for the Shanti Virus.  What he didn't know was that his daughter, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-49564\" href=\"/elle-bishop/4005-49564/\" slug=\"elle-bishop\"> Elle Bishop</a> had kidnapped by Noah and West .  So the two made an exchange.  On the beach at dawn Noah and West arrived with Elle, while Bob and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47676\" href=\"/mohinder-suresh/4005-47676/\" slug=\"mohinder-suresh\"> Mohinder</a> arrived with Claire.  Claire was safely back with West, who followed Noah's orders and flew away with her.  As they were leaivng the scene, Elle threw lightning at them.   <br/> <br/>Thanks to Claire,  they survived the fall.  However, Noah was attacked by Mohinder.  Noah survived when he received a dose from Claire's blood.  <br/><br/>Claire decided to expose the Company.  West arrived to try to talk her out of it.  However, Claire gave West the file on him and told him to make up his own mind.  West flew away, indicating that he would rather keep his ability a secret, than stay with Claire.  <br/> <br/>After Nathan's death, Claire told Peter that he had a boyfriend once named West who attends now to the New York University and has the ability of flight.Peter had a strange request from Claire:Call West for him.Peter than met up with the boy and mimiced his ability and flew away to exact revenge on Sylar.<br/> <br/> <h2>Powers </h2><br/> West possesses the ability of flight.  As demostrated he can fly with much more speed than Nathan.  However, he doesn't posses enhanced strength.  Therefore, it is difficult to lift heavy objects to great heights.",

Her father is a <a title=\"Pastor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor\" rel=\"nofollow\">pastor</a> and her mother sings in the <a title=\"Local church\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_church\" rel=\"nofollow\">church</a> <a title=\"Choir\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir\" rel=\"nofollow\">choir</a>. Chapel has four brothers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Studying medicine, Chapel entered an internship in <a href=\"/california/4020-55716/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\">California</a> and was taken under the wing of famed surgeon <a href=\"/charles-mcnider/4005-9301/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9301\">Dr. Charles McNider</a>. McNider believed that Chapel had potential to perhaps be the most talented surgeon he had met in his career.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dr. Midnight was created by writer <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a> and artist <a href=\"/todd-mcfarlane/4040-3380/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3380\">Todd McFarlane.</a> Chapel was originally introduced in (Pre-Crisis) <a href=\"/earth-2/4015-56462/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56462\">Earth-2</a>. After <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> much of her origin remained intact in the (Post-Crisis) New Earth continuity.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205905\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/205905-100352-doctor-midnight.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.042735042735\" data-width=\"234\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 234px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:204.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/205905-100352-doctor-midnight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205905\"><img alt=\"Dr. Midnight (Dr. Mid-Nite II)\" src=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/205905-100352-doctor-midnight.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8842/205905-100352-doctor-midnight.jpg 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" data-width=\"234\"></a><figcaption>Dr. Midnight (Dr. Mid-Nite II)</figcaption></figure><p>Her mentor, Dr. Charles McNider, was actually the wartime hero once calling himself <a href=\"/doctor-mid-nite/4005-11238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11238\">Dr. Mid-Nite</a>. During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, an earthquake wracked the hospital where Beth worked. While trying to rescue her patients, she was blinded by an oxygen explosion. Dr. McNider took it upon himself to operate on her. Since he couldn’t restore normal vision McNider and a team of fellow physicians gave Chapel Hi-tech ocular implants causing a connection to her pineal gland, allowing to partially restore her vision. Although her eyes became too sensitive for normal light, Chapel developed extremely sharp vision in total darkness.</p><p>She was than surprised to find out that her mentor, McNider, revealed himself as Dr. Mid-Nite. On that encounter McNider inspired Chapel to look at her misfortune as a unique gift. She then met <a href=\"/rick-tyler/4005-21393/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21393\">Rick Tyler</a> the son of the original <a href=\"/hourman/4005-7643/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7643\">Hour-Man</a>, and discovered she could see in darkness while fighting some of the <a href=\"/anti-monitor/4005-12165/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12165\">Anti-Monitor</a>'s <a href=\"/shadow-demons/4060-56363/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56363\">shadow demons</a>.</p><p>Chapel than fashioned a set of special goggles, a set of \"blackout bombs\" grenades, and her mother crafts her daughter's hero costume from a choir robe. Chapel dawns the costume to become the new Dr. Midnight, and joined with the new Hour-Man, petitioned to join <a href=\"/infinity-inc/4060-40384/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40384\">Infinity Inc</a>. Only briefly adventuring with the group, and being the in house physician, Chapel served as a dedicated member of Infinity Inc. Chapel formed a close friendship with the flamboyant <a href=\"/yolanda-montez/4005-47728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47728\">Yolanda Montez</a>, <a href=\"/wildcat/4005-7645/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7645\">Wildcat</a> II, becoming a constant influence in Yolanda's life. Chapel also formed a brief but close romance with Hour-Man, helping him with his fears of the addictive properties of the <a href=\"/miraclo/4055-47183/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47183\">Miraclo</a> drug his father had created. As time went on the group formally disbanded, mostly due to their disillusionment after their founder <a href=\"/skyman/4005-42875/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42875\">Skyman</a>'s death.</p><p>All the members went their own ways but Yolanda and Chapel continued to have close relations. Chapel would later find herself joining <a href=\"/amanda-waller/4005-4920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\">Amanda Waller</a>'s secret team of meta-humans called the <a href=\"/shadow-fighters/4060-47147/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47147\">Shadow Fighters</a>. Along with Wildcat II, <a href=\"/commander-steel/4005-23481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23481\">Commander Steel</a>, <a href=\"/manhunter/4005-2529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2529\">Manhunter III</a>, and <a href=\"/major-victory/4005-26868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26868\">Major Victory</a>, Chapel agreed to the mission to search and capture <a href=\"/eclipso/4005-3763/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3763\">Eclipso</a>. However the assignment went awry and Wildcat went ahead of the team, Chapel followed and also got separated from the rest of the group. When Chapel found Wildcat who was seriously injured and bleeding to death. Sadly she was killed mercilessly by Eclipso after begging him to allow her to operate on the dying Wildcat.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>During the events of <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4045-40764/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40764\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, Chapel tried to rescue her patients from an unexpected earthquake that stroked the Sunset Medical Center. Chapel was blinded by an explosion from several oxygen tanks and nearly got herself killed by her heroic acts.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3><strong>Super Sight</strong></h3><p>When Doctor Beth Chapel went through her ocular operation she received the special ability to see perfectly in total or near darkness.</p><h3><strong>Unarmed Combat</strong></h3><p>Chapel is a skilled acrobat and unarmed combatant, having practiced with a myriad of meta-human comrades in arms.</p><h3><b>Skills</b></h3><p>She also had a Doctrine in medicine and had been an accomplished surgeon, rivaling McNider himself in her capacity to take on the most complex of operations.</p><h3><b>Equipment</b></h3><p>Infrared Lenses used to see in the light. Dr. Midnight used \"blackout bombs\" which release pitch-black gas that blind villains and allow Chapel to see.</p><h3><b>Weaknesses</b></h3><p>She was able to perceive her surroundings as if it were daylight, however she was unable to see in the light and in effect blind by day.</p><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><p><b>Height:</b> 5'8\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 118 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Brown</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Black</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h2>Earth-2(Post-52)</h2><p>Little is known thus far about the female Dr. Midnight of Earth-2 save that she is a current member of the <a title=\"Justice Society Infinity (Earth-2)\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Justice_Society_Infinity_(Earth-2)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society Infinity</a> of her source Earth and that she currently serves as the team's official medical officer and specialist.</p><p>Chapel was the person who confirmed that <a title=\"Kara Zor-L\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kara_Zor-L\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kara Zor-L</a> of <a title=\"Earth-Two\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-Two\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth-Two</a>/<a title=\"New Earth\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/New_Earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a> is not the missing <a title=\"Power Girl\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Girl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Girl</a> native to <a title=\"Earth-2\" href=\"http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth-2</a>, but a completely separate person.

    "description": "<p>Ted Sprague was able to manipulate radiation which he discovered after he had his first encounter with the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47667\" href=\"/haitian/4005-47667/\" slug=\"haitian\">   Haitian</a> and was later kidnapped by the organization called 'The Company'.  He first manifested his ability when he bought flowers for his wife, but the flower was destroyed.  Soon after, his wife was diagnosed with cancer, which she gained from 'radiation exposure'.  His wife ultimately died and Ted was arrested by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47673\" href=\"/matt-parkman/4005-47673/\" slug=\"matt-parkman\">   Matt Parkman</a>. <br/><br/>In the interrogation room, Ted confessed that he has these two strange marks on his neck and didn't know where he got them because two days from his past were a 'blur'.  Matt and Ted almost shared the same fate but before they could found anything, Ted was taken away by the FBI.  Matt was later called by his partner who informed him that Ted had escaped.  <br/><br/>For a few weeks there wasn't any sign of Ten's whereabouts.  Ted eventually re-appeared in the Nevada Desert where he had been hiding from the authorities in a small house.  <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48431\" href=\"/hana-gitelman/4005-48431/\" slug=\"hana-gitelman\">   Wireless</a> made contact with Ted and the two decided to recruit Parkman in order to stop the Company.  They broke into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47669\" href=\"/hrg/4005-47669/\" slug=\"hrg\">   Noah Bennet's</a> house only to shoot <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47664\" href=\"/claire-bennet/4005-47664/\" slug=\"claire-bennet\">   Claire</a> and being betrayed by Parkman.  Claire healed as Noah, Matt and the Haitian tried to stop Ted but Noah's boss, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-56011\" href=\"/riley-thomson/4040-56011/\" slug=\"riley-thomson\">   Thomson</a> arrived.  Thomson shot Ted who began to loose control of his ability and a nuclear explosion detonated; destroying the Bennet house.  <br/><br/>Parkman and Ted were locked away with Bennet, but they managed to escape with Noah's help.  Ted's ability evolved.  Upon their arrival in New York City they met up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47678\" href=\"/peter-petrelli/4005-47678/\" slug=\"peter-petrelli\">   Peter Petrelli</a> and Claire Bennet.  Peter mimicked Ted's ability, but the first time he managed to control it Claire, Peter and Ted wanted to go to the police in order to take <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\" href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" slug=\"sylar\">   Sylar</a> into custody.  However, the FBI arrived and arrested Ted. <br/> <br/>It was revealed that Sylar was the one who called them so with this, later that night Sylar using his telekinesis, stopped the van killed everyone including Ted too and stole his ability. <br/>  <br/>Ted hasn't been seen or mentions since.  <br/> <br/>Ted Sprague is mentioned by Sylar as a victim of his while Hiro has a hallucination.<br/> <br/></p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2> <br/>Ted Sprague was able to fry things with his hands and create radiation.His power was stolen by Sylar when he murdered Ted during his transport to the prison.Peter Petrelli exploded over New York due this ability.This ability was used last time in an exposed future where Gabriel Gray aka. Sylar's son, Noah was murdered and due the agony and pain, he exploded destroying Costa Verde.",

    "deck": "Astro Boy was created by Osamu Tezuka, the \"Father of Manga\". As the story goes, Astro Boy is a child robot made by Dr. Tenma to replace his dead son. Instead, he becomes the greatest superhero.",
    "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Astro Boy, whose real name is Atom, is a powerful boy robot created by the head of the Ministry of Science, known as Doctor Tenma. He created him in order to replace his dead son, Tobio, after he died in a car accident. In fact, Dr. Tenma built Atom to resemble Tobio phsycially, and he treated him as if he were his real son. In time however, Dr. Tenma realized that Atom could not fill the void left over from the loss of his son since Atom could not grow or appreciate human qualities in the same way as a real child. As a result, Dr. Tenma rejected Atom, who then ranaway and innocently signed himself over to a cruel circus owner named Hamegg. Hamegg used androids in his show for the amusement of others, and was often very abusive of them.</p><p>After suffering in Hamegg's circus for an extended period, Atom met Professor Ochanomizu, the new head of the Ministry of Science. The Professor managed to make Hamegg turn the android over to him and became Atom's legal guardian. He soon realized that the boy robot was gifted with great powers, and that remarkably he was also able to experience human emotions.</p><p>Under Professor Ochanomizu's guidance, Atom used his powers to fight crime and injustice, such as prejudice since most of his enemies were robot-hating humans. He became known as Astro Boy, the world's greatest superhero, and went on to fight everything from robots gone mad, to alien invaders. </p><h2>Anime Series</h2><p>Astro Boy, called Tetsuwan Atomu (meaning \"Mighty Atom\") in Japanese, was first shown on Japanese TV in 1963. That original series, which ran for three years, is considered the first series to embody the aesthetic that became known as anime. The character itself however, originated in a manga from 1951 by Osamu Tezuka. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Dark Horse Comics</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"4010-364\" href=\"/dark-horse-comics/4010-364/\">     Dark Horse</a> published the first <a data-ref-id=\"4050-31887\" href=\"/astro-boy/4050-31887/\">    English version</a> of Astro Boy in 2002. The stories followed the original Japanese, Tetsuwan Atomu, almost exactly but with the artwork flipped so they read from left to right for the Western readers. It was translated by Frederik L. Schodt, who retained most of the Japanese names and kept the storyline set in Japan. It was Schodt who gave Astro Boy his English name rather than calling him <i>Mighty Atom</i> because he felt that a Japanese character called Atom in an American comic was \"going against too much history\". </p> <br /><h2>PLUTO</h2>In 2003 there was a manga published based on Osamu Tezuka's \"The Greatest Robot On Earth\" Astro Boy story. Unlike the original, this one is not told with Astro Boy as the main character but another robot Gesicht. Astro is a former peace ambassador toward the end of the 39th Middle East War and was created by Tenma after losing his own son. The series is about an investigation of murders of WMD robots and those responsible for creating them along with dealing with the suggestion that a robot is committing these murders despite the fact that robots cannot bring harm to a human. When Gesicht first meets Astro to warn him that the killer is targeting the seven most powerful robots in the world and that he may be in danger, he notes how his sensors are having trouble picking up whether he's a human or robot child. They also converse about Astro's tendency to eat ice cream as an act despite the fact that he can't taste or needs to consume it along with his want for a toy a boy was using while passing by the window. All of these things surprised Gesicht and he admits that Astro's A.I. is much more advance than his. <br /> <br />Later in the series Astro, in an attempt to save his sister, takes on Pluto, the mysterious murderous robot with weather manipulating ability and dies doing so. The world mourns Astro while he's dead, but it's later revealed that he's in a more catatonic state due to his perfect A.I. Tenma returns to reactivate Astro and reveals that Astro will not revive anytime soon due to his artificial intelligence taking an infinite amount of consideration in picking out of six billion or so personalities and that there was only one way to revive Astro. Inject extreme emotion into him but this can have an adverse reaction and the Astro that wakes from the state that he's in could turn out to be evil instead of the good Astro that fought Pluto. The procedure was done using a copy of Gesicht's brain, who had extreme hatred in his memories and eventually Astro awoke. <br /> <br />Initially he was unresponsive until he asked for a pen. With the pen he etched the equation for the end of the world in the form of a weapon known as an Anti-Proton Bomb. Shortly after, he burst through the wall and escaped Japan's Ministry of Science building where he came to his senses while picking up a snail much like the day when he met Gesicht. After meeting with Gesicht's wife, Astro took off to the United States of Thracia where he would face Pluto in Eden Park. After a battle, Astro unwillingly broadcasts Gesicht's dying thoughts: \"Nothing is born of hatred.\" The thought brought the two combatants to tears and they eventually stopped fighting until a volcano became agitated at the park. Pluto and Astro face off against Goji, another creation of Tenma who didn't know he was a robot and planted an Anti-Proton Bomb inside a large pocket of magma and a robot that Goji had transferred his mind into called Bora. <br /> <br />Pluto eventually tosses Astro from the erupting volcano and sacrifices himself to save the world, using his power to freeze the erupting supervolcano and the Anti-Proton Bomb's detination all in one fell swoop. The story ends with Astro mourning Pluto and those he killed and Astro being left as the Greatest Robot in the World.",

    "deck": "Azula is the crown Princess of the Fire Nation and the little sister of Zuko. She is a ruthless Firebending Prodigy and a cunning sociopath.",
    "description": "<h2>Background</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Princess Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa about two years after her brother, Prince Zuko. She is named for her grandfather, Ozai's father, Fire Lord Azulon. Azula grew up in the riches, splendor and privileges of being royalty in the Fire Nation. Her sharp wits and the fact that she is a Firebending prodigy gained great attention and acclaim, and quickly made her Ozai's favorite child. Her father began raising her as his true heir early on, taking her into his confidence and grooming her in politics, while mostly ignoring Zuko. She attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where she befriended Mai and Ty Lee.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Even when she was only nine years old, Azula displayed her natural talents, along with her tendency for malice and perfection. When Ty Lee succeeded in performing a cartwheel after Azula had fallen over attempting to do her own, Azula responded by shoving her friend to the ground and laughing gleefully. When she saw ten-year-old Mai attempting to hide her crush on her brother Zuko, Azula used her acting and cunning to convince her mother to make Zuko play with them. She then placed an apple on Mai's head and set it on fire, forcing Zuko to tackle her into a fountain.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A true megalomaniac, Azula desired power from a young age, suggesting that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the heir apparent, her Uncle Iroh. She is shown destroying a doll that Iroh had sent her as a gift from the Earth Kingdom. Not long after this, her cousin Lu Ten was killed, causing Iroh to abandoning his legendary 600 day siege at Ba Sing Se, which in turn prompted Azula to dub him \"a quitter and a loser\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after receiving this news, Azula and the rest of her family went before Fire Lord Azulon, and she put on a spectacular display of her Firebending prowess. She then smugly watched Zuko try the same performance and fail. When Azulon sent everyone but Ozai out of the room, Azula took her brother and hid behind the curtains. From there, she watched her father request that he be made Fire Lord instead of Iroh. When Zuko fled in fear from the Fire Lord's anger, Azula stayed to watch with amusement. Azula then supposedly heard her grandfather sentence her brother to death--a fact that she wasted no time in gleefully reporting to the brother in question. She taunted him until her mother angrily pulled her away for a talk. What happens after this is unknown, but Azula was next seen playing with a knife that Zuko had received from Iroh, and coolly announcing that their grandfather had passed away and their mother had vanished. Soon after, she was watching her father's coronation with glee. No love developed between her and Zuko throughout the next few years, as Ozai apparently began to favor her more and more over her brother during this period.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula, alongside Iroh and Zhao, watched Zuko's Agni Kai with Ozai. When her father burns her brother's face, she is seen smiling in triumph. When Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation, Azula officially became Ozai's heir. For the next three years, she would continue her relentless training in Firebending, strategy and combat, until she refined herself enough to serve her father. By this time her firebending advances to the level where her fire turns blue thus increasing her overall bending power and intensity.</p><h2><b>Book 1: Water</b></h2><h4><b>A New Mission</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after Zhao's failed attack on the Northern Water Tribe, Azula is summoned by her father to his throne room. Kneeling before Fire Lord Ozai, he comments that Zuko is a failure and Iroh is a traitor, and charges her with a mission: to find and capture her uncle and brother.</p><h2><b>Book 2: Earth</b></h2><h4><b>A Family Reunion</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Fire Lord Ozai branded Iroh a traitor and her brother Zuko a failure, she willingly obeyed her father's command for her to go and capture them, as seen in the final seconds of the first season finale. While en-route, she worked at perfecting her ability to create lightning, with the aid of her advisors and masters Lo and Li. In \" The Avatar State\", Azula attempted to capture Zuko and Iroh, (now considered traitors to the Fire Nation) luring Zuko with the false promise of being accepted home with open arms. When Zuko learned of the deception, though, he attacked her. She easily evaded his attacks, and struck back with taunts and brief attacks. However, she failed to finish her brother off, as Iroh redirected her lightning attack away from Zuko and into a nearby cliff, and then kicked her off the edge of the ship.</p><h4><b>A New Target</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Counseled by her twin masters Lo and Li that the royal procession was not a wise choice to accompany her on her mission, she agreed and decided to abandon the unit, opting to find and recruit her two childhood friends in \" Return to Omashu\". Ty Lee required some \"convincing\" as she had already started a life at the circus, but Mai was only too willing to leave the boredom of the conquered city of Omashu in favor of going on an exciting hunt especially if it involved interacting with her childhood lover Zuko. Whilt in the city, Azula renamed Omashu as the city of New Ozai in honor of her father.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During this episode, Azula first encountered the Avatar, Aang. She and her new allies were almost able to defeat Aang and his friends, but their overall unpreparedness as well as a trump card delivered by a shrewd King Bumi enabled the Team Avatar the time needed to escape the city. Soon after the battle, she named the Avatar as a personal target in addition to her brother and uncle.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Princess Azula and her two friends are not seen again until \" The Chase\", where they relentlessly pursued the Avatar's group, using a highly advanced Fire Nation tank train and three Mongoose Dragons as mounts to pursue them night and day. After wearing down the foursome, Azula decided thay should split up, as Aang tried to lead Azula and her friends away from Sokka and Katara's trail. Azula noticed the deception, however, and sent Ty Lee and Mai to follow Sokka and Katara, while she continued chasing down the Avatar. Azula encountered the Avatar in an abandoned town and prepared to fight him; she was interrupted, though, by her brother Zuko, who had tracked them and had his own plans for capturing Aang. Azula fought the two boys, and despite the fact that both mostly concentrated on attacking her, she dominated the fight,easily landing a knockout blow on Zuko and later trapping Aang beneath some fallen rubble. Victory was denied to her, however, when Katara, Sokka, and Toph showed up to rescue Aang, while Iroh arrived to help Zuko. Cornered, she claimed to be willing to give in, saying that \"a princess surrenders with honor\", but to everyone's surprise and dismay, Azula took advantage of Iroh momentarily being off guard and seriously wounded him with a bolt of blue fire, then escaped as the four benders attacked with their respective elements.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula was not seen again until \" The Drill\", where she, along with her allies Mai and Ty Lee, were overseeing War Minister Qin's efforts to use a giant drill to break through the outer wall of Ba Sing Se. When the engineers reported an accident involving an ambushed engineer, stolen drill schematics, and further sabotage, Azula recognized that it was the work of the Avatar. Upon finding Aang, Katara, and Sokka attempting to break the engine's braces, Azula forced Aang and his gang to quickly flee. She sent Mai and Ty Lee after Katara and Sokka while Azula followed Aang, once again claiming personal ownership over the Avatar's capture. She caught Aang trying to bore a hole at the top of the drill, and they began a brutal match. Her firebending nearly overwhelmed the young Avatar, but he continued to fight as the drill bored its way through the wall. The fight ended in a rather undignified manner, with the drill's slurry water pipes bursting and Azula slipping into Aang; both of them almost fell off the drill. Azula tried to regain the advantage, but Aang was faster--by the time she had recovered, he was already on his way down the wall to destroy the drill. Azula gave one final strike with flame, but was a second too slow. Aang's powerful impact on the earthen wedge destroyed the drill and knocked Azula away.</p><h4><b>Fall of Ba Sing Se</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Following this incident, Azula took Mai and Ty Lee and began hunting for the Avatar's bison, once again following his trail of hair. When the princess and her companions finally came across him in \" Appa's Lost Days\", he was in a forest clearing being tended to by a group of female warriors--the Kyoshi Warriors. After a few snide remarks in which she dismissed the warriors as the Avatar's \"fangirls\", Azula and her friends initiated a fight. Azula engaged Suki in a swift one-on-one battle and managed to disarm the warrior and knocked her to the ground; however, she was distracted by another Kyoshi Warrior and turned to fight her instead. By the time she returned to Suki, Suki had already driven Appa off with a flaming branch. Suki then proceeded to take a firm stance, whereas Azula merely condescendingly teased her again, before rushing in to battle--the girls clashed, but the rest of the fight was left unseen.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was made clear that the Kyoshi Warriors did not claim victory in this battle--at the conclusion of \" The Earth King\", three girls dressed in Kyoshi Warrior uniforms were welcomed by the Earth King--and the leader of the girls was unmistakably Azula.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Shortly after, in the episode \" The Guru\", The Earth King revealed that he had had a troubling week, with Long Feng and the Dai Li planning to take over. Azula's initial smug amusement at the irony of the situation turned to a sudden concern, though, when he revealed to them that the Earth Kingdom will invade the Fire Nation--on the day of a solar eclipse. Azula was visibly caught off-guard by this information, and immediately begins to consider what to do.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Afterwards, she confided to Ty Lee and Mai that she planned to take control of the Dai Li and take down Ba Sing Se from the inside. She developed a plan to inform the Dai Li of their true nature, and thus spread the word on to their leader, Long Feng. The plan was successful, and Azula was taken by Dai Li agents in the middle of the night to Long Feng, who struck a deal with her. He gave her control of the Dai Li to overthrow the government in exchange for the Avatar.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Meanwhile, in the \"The Guru\", Katara discovered that Zuko and Iroh were in the city, and approached Azula, thinking her to be Suki, and informed her of her brother's presence. Azula revealed herself, and before Katara could warn anyone, Ty Lee took the young waterbender down. Azula proceeded to lock her in the crystal catacombs beneath the city and have a \"family reunion\" by sending a letter to Iroh and Zuko, telling them that the Earth King wished for them to serve him tea. Near the beginning of \" The Crossroads of Destiny\", the pair fell into her trap, and became surrounded by Dai Li agents. However, Iroh managed to escape them and the palace--Zuko, on the other hand, chose to stay behind to face Azula, challenging her to an Agni-Kai. His sister nonchalantly turned it down, and he was overwhelmed by the Dai Li. He was then imprisoned in the same dungeon as Katara.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally, Azula unleashed her coup upon the city, and the Dai Li arrested the Council of Five, the Earth King's highest ranking generals, while she personally captured the Earth King. Sokka and Toph were arrested as well while attempting to warn the Earth King of the danger, and Azula sent them off to a separate dungeon. Immediately afterward, Long Feng arrived on the scene and commanded the Dai Li to arrest Azula, smugly proclaiming a double-cross. The laugh was all Azula's, though, as she gleefully explained that the Dai Li were so impressed by her that they no longer knew who to follow. In fact earlier, a Dai Li agent had remarked to Long Feng that Azula was \"both terrifying and inspirational at the same time\"; a perfect example of her Machiavellian talents. In a smug and verbose speech, she denounced him for his lack of the divine right to rule--something she possessed and boasted about. She ended by commanding Long Feng to bow to her, since he could not compete with somebody born to rule. He grudgingly obliged, saying that she had beaten him at his own game. She scathingly replied that he was \"never even a player\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula appeared one last time in the chapter, shortly after Iroh and Aang found Katara and Zuko. Aang and Katara had been sent off by Iroh to find Sokka and Toph, while he remained behind for a moment with Zuko to bring him finally over to the side of good. However, his choice would not be complete without the devil upon his shoulder, and Azula was only too willing to play that part. Using the Dai Li to immobilize Iroh, she put her tongue and wit to the ultimate test, promising that their father would restore Zuko's honor and that she needed him--she promised him everything if he would help her. She closed the argument by leaving him to choose his own destiny and going after Katara and the Avatar. However, things were not going in her favor during the beginning of the battle, as her attacks could not break through their defense, and she found herself surrounded on both sides by Aang and Katara. Just when it seemed that she might lose the battle, her work came to fruition. Zuko arrived, and after a moment of consideration, chose to attack the Avatar. A long battle ensued and Azula attacked Katara only to be held back in a dire predicament, with one leg and one arm immobilized in water. Azula was saved by Zuko's timely intervention, and actually gave him an approving look before proceeding to fight the Avatar. After disabling him, she moved to end the stalemate between her brother and Katara. Together, she and Zuko easily overwhelmed her. The Dai Li joined them within a few moments, and Azula and her brother appeared unstoppable.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Aang then closed himself off in a chamber of crystal; the rest of the room stared as he entered the Avatar State. However, Azula positioned herself behind the Avatar, and used her lightning to strike the Avatar in the back before he could unleash his own assault. She would have been the Avatar's killer if not for Katara's timely recovery and swift waterbending; all the same, the Avatar was unable to fight, and Azula and Zuko were unquestionably the victors. As the siblings approached the defeated duo, though, they were blocked by the timely appearance of Iroh. He temporarily held off Azula, Zuko, and the Dai Li, allowing himself to be captured once Katara had made her escape with Aang. Later, in the throne room of the Earth King, Azula assures a concerned Zuko that he had restored his honor by joining her, and that Iroh had been the one who had betrayed him--not the other way around. His honor was restored, she explained--for after a hundred years, she and Zuko had finally conquered the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se.</p><h2><b>Book 3: Fire</b></h2><h4><b>Returning Home</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In \"Going Home Again\", a canonical interlude comic featured within the second All-Avatar Nick Mag Presents edition, Azula is shown making arrangements for their return to Fire Nation. One of which is passing her position as ruler of Ba Sing Se over to Joo Dee, whom she views as the perfect person to leave in her stead, dubbing the former tour guide Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator. Azula then refuses to take no as an answer when a reluctant Zuko chooses to remain in Ba Sing Se. Gathering Ty Lee, the princess schemes to use Mai and Zuko's mutual childhood crushes to entice her brother's decision. With the false report of a meeting with a Admiral Liang, she sets the two up on a Fire Nation-themed dinner date, featuring the Dai Li agents serving as waiters. However, the ruse is uncovered when Zuko overhears Azula and Ty Lee giggling in the nearby bushes. The princess attempts to catch herself, claiming that she was just telling Ty Lee to stop messing around in the bushes. Neither Zuko nor Mai buys into the tale and leave off on a private walk around Ba Sing Se.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The following day, while boarding the ships, Azula looks on at Zuko and Mai speaking affectionately with one another and concludes that her plan seems to have been quite successful after all. She then turns to her chained uncle and wonders aloud if the prisoner will even survive the trip home. As she bids her brother farewell, Zuko suddenly makes the resolve to come with them back to the Fire Nation. Azula slyly tells her brother to do whatever he wants, as it's his decision.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In \" The Awakening\", Azula and Zuko return home and both are welcomed with open arms by the people, with a rally held in their honor to praise their successful efforts at the Earth Kingdom capital. Later at the old turtle duck pond, Azula and Zuko converse about Zuko's long-awaited meeting with their father. Zuko is anxious not only about the upcoming audience, but also that he must return to his father without the Avatar. Azula shrugs it off, once again restating her position that the debt is repaid by the Avatar being dead. At this, Zuko momentarily hesitates to agree in Aang's supposed demise. Azula however appears to disregard it and simply walks away.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Zuko at last meets his father, it is revealed that Azula misinformed Ozai that he was the one who killed the Avatar. Perplexed, Zuko immediately goes to Azula's chamber to question her actions. Azula claims that she saw how worried Zuko was about not having the Avatar, she decided to give him the credit for his demise out of a generous gesture to repay his aid in the takeover of Ba Sing Se. Zuko refuses to believe her explanation, accusing her of retaining an ulterior motive. Azula nonchalantly points out how letting him have all the glory over slaying the Avatar could do little to benefit her, but insidiously acknowledges the fact that should it be discovered that the Avatar was indeed alive, all that glory would swiftly turn into shame and foolishness. She assures Zuko that he has nothing to worry about, as he already said himself, there's no way the Avatar could have survived. With that, the princess bids her deeply incensed brother goodnight.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In \" The Beach\", Azula, Mai, Ty Lee, and Zuko all travel to Ember Island for a brief vacation while the Fire Lord confers with his advisors in private. Azula takes advantage of this opportunity to experience life as a normal person for the very first time, choosing to keep her and Zuko's true identity a secret. At the beach Chan and his friend, Ruon-Jian, are impressed by Ty Lee and Mai. The two decide to invite Ty Lee and Mai to a party at Chan's house. Azula then interrupts Chan by insisting that she and Zuko are invited also. When Azula and the others arrive at his house, Azula mentions that his \"sharp\" outfit is so sharp that it can puncture the hull of an empire class fire nation battle ship leaving thousands to drown at sea. This \"compliment\" weirds out Chan and he awkwardly thanks her. Later, after shooting down Ty Lee confines in her that she needed help talking to boys. After very short and awkward lessons, Azula insists that Chan give her a tour of the house. He leads her out onto the deck and starts making a few jokes. Chan then moves in and kisses Azula. He then calls her pretty and she replies with \"Together, you and I will be the strongest couple in the entire world! We will dominate the earth!\", coupled with a small display of her unique blue flames. Chan then makes an excuse to leave. Later, Azula plays the role of interpreter as the group takes turns telling stories which provide deep insight about how their lives have been. When her turn comes, Azula states she doesn't have a \"pathetic sob story\". However, she does softly admit that she was aware that her mother loved Zuko more and thought she was a monster, but callously adds that her mother was right, but it still hurt. It is later on hinted that Azula harbors repressed feelings of rage towards her mother for this. For the first time, she is seen as almost completely vulnerable and almost seems to have resigned herself to what she is in the absence of her mother. As a testament of their special day, Azula proceeds to lead the others into disrupting the party and trashing Chan's home.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In \" Nightmares and Daydreams\", Azula, along with her father, brother, and all the high-ranking military officials in the Fire Nation, attends an important all-day war meeting. It is later revealed that, at that meeting, Azula was the one who suggested burning to ashes the entire Earth Kingdom using the power of Sozin's Comet, a plan that Ozai readily adopted, much to Zuko's dismay.</p><h4><b>The Day of Black Sun</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A few minutes after the beginning of the solar eclipse, as the Avatar, Toph, and Sokka manage to locate and burst into the Fire Lord's underground room, they are confounded to instead find Azula. She reveals that she's known about the invasion for months and is fully prepared to face and delay the attackers. Azula has two Dai Li agents she brought back from Ba Sing Se attack the trio while she runs away, closely pursued by Aang, Sokka and Toph. Once the agents have been defeated and Azula is cornered, Sokka realizes that she's merely wasting their time and that they should just forget her in favor of searching for Ozai. As they start to leave, Azula mentions Suki to Sokka, stating that she gave up hope on him ever rescuing her from her imprisonment. This revelation promptly makes Sokka charge at her in blind rage. Azula pulls out a shuriken, but Toph senses it and pins her to the wall. Sokka furiously demands to know where Suki is while Azula simply remains silent. When the eclipse ends, Azula breaks her restraints and coyly informs the trio of Ozai's precise location before running down the hall. As the invasion draws to a close, the princess is shown observing the Avatar and his friends escape aboard Appa from her airship. However, she chooses not give pursuit, knowing that sooner or later, they'll be back.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During Azula's confrontation with the group, Zuko confronts his father, Ozai, and tells him that Azula lied to him by saying that Zuko killed the Avatar, when in reality Azula struck down the Avatar but he managed to survive in the end. Ironically, Ozai seems to have pardoned his daughter for these crimes, as in \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\" she evidently has not faced punishment. Azula may have manipulated him once again.</p><h4><b>Betrayed</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\" Azula arrives at the prison with Ty Lee and Mai (who does not accompany her, but instead sees Zuko). She interrupts the Warden, who is initially angry at the interruption, but as soon as he finds out it was Azula, he bows down to her. As the Warden interrogates a guard who was supposedly an impostor, Azula tells the Warden that he has the wrong guard.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She and Ty Lee later battle Sokka, Suki, and Zuko on the gondola. While Ty Lee fights Suki, Azula takes on Zuko and Sokka. Zuko manages to block her fire blasts, while Sokka moves in to strike her with his sword, nearly cutting her throat and stabbing her. Yet, despite their efforts, neither Zuko nor Sokka manage to defeat her. As the guards are about to cut the lines and drop the gondola into the boiling lake below, she and Ty Lee backflip to the other gondola. Much to her dismay, she finds her friend Mai defeating the guards to save Zuko and his friends.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the battle, she tells Mai that she should not have saved Zuko, since she knew the consequences. However, Mai tells Azula that she miscalculated, and she now loves Zuko more than she fears Azula. The idea of an emotion she has probably never experienced being stronger than her ability to instill fear and control sends her over the edge. As the tension rises, Azula and Mai are about to fight, but just before Azula can attack, Ty Lee suddenly blocks off two of her chi paths and paralyzes her, much to the surprise of all three of the girls. The guards come to Azula's aid, and she tells the guards to put Ty Lee and Mai where she can never see their faces again, and \"let them rot\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This marks an important turning point in her life because following the betrayal of her friends, Mai and Ty lee, she never displays her cold merciless precision and clarity of mind again. It's possible that she considered them to be the only friends she had ever had, and that it seemed to her that Zuko had stolen them from her.</p><h4><b>The Southern Raiders</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A few days after her defeat at the Boiling Rock, Azula tracked Zuko and Sokka down to the Western Air Temple. She attacked with a full fleet of airships, and was intent on killing Zuko more than ever before. When Zuko asks what she's doing there she tells him that she is about to become only child, intent on killing him. Zuko attempts to attack her and is once again successful in holding her off while the gang escapes. Azula delivers a huge attack on Zuko that forces him to counterattack. The two siblings in turn caused a huge explosion that sent them falling into the ravine below. Zuko was saved by Katara on Appa, but Azula could expect no help. Despite her fall, Azula manages to stop her descent by propelling herself towards a cliff with her blue flames, using her hairpiece as a grapple. Despite the failure of the attack, Azula clearly intends on striking once again. In this episode, we begin to see the decline of Azula's mental health.</p><h4><b>The Ember Island Players</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the play her character shows no signs of her cruelty likely due to propaganda. However, at the end of the play her character kills Zuko's character to wild cheers, which leaves the real Zuko looking taken aback.</p><h4><b>Descent into Madness</b></h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Ozai crowned himself Phoenix King, he appointed Azula to be the new Fire Lord (after a short discussion in which Azula felt he was looking down on her in the same way he did to Zuko). Azula, however, had already begun to lose her grip on reality and her father not wanting her with him only made it worse. She began banishing her subjects out of fear and paranoia, including a servant for leaving a pit in her cherries, which she took as a crime against her life, and the Dai Li, for taking five minutes to arrive after being summoned (during which she believes \"an assassin could have done away [with her] and been on his merry way\"). When Lo and Li confronted the Princess on her well being, she became enraged, and told the twins they must have an Agni Kai. When Lo and Li said they couldn't because they aren't firebenders, Azula banished Lo while pointing at Li, confusing them as to who was banished. With all her subjects banished, she attempted to fix her hair herself, and instead cut a large chunk out of it out of spite. It also appears that she wasn't sleeping well as she had dark circles under her eyes by this point. She was also haunted by a hallucination of her mother. In her hallucination, her mother showed sorrow, as her daughter was, in her mind, confused. After Ursa told Azula she loved her, Azula threw her hairbrush at her mirror in a fit of emotional rage, ending the hallucination. Azula then falls to her knees bitterly sobbing to herself.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Her coronation, without the Fire Nation subjects and only the Fire Sages that are present, was interrupted by her brother and Katara. Zuko proclaimed that he would be Fire Lord. Azula challenged Zuko to an Agni Kai, which Zuko accepted, noticing that something was off about her. At first, they seem to be evenly matched, but as Azula continues to slip into insanity, she begins to tire herself out. Zuko taunts her, declaring she was afraid to hit him with lightning. Azula takes the bait, shouting \"I'll show you lightning!\". She first aims at Zuko, but then realizes Katara is vulnerable, and shoots at her. Zuko then jumps in the way, and takes the lightning bolt head-on trying to redirect it in mid-air; even though he succeeds, some of it still remains in his body, seriously harming him and removing him from the fight.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula then moves on to Katara, who is distraught over Zuko's injury. Azula does her best to keep Katara away from any water, frequently insulting the duo, calling her a filthy peasant, and saying \"Zuzu, you don't look so good\". Katara eventually immobilizes her in a frozen splash of water from an underground canal and used the opportunity to chain her to the floor. When Azula saw her brother stand up alive, she finally broke. She began to breathe fire in a fit of rage, rolling around the floor, screaming and crying uncontrollably, reduced to a feral state, completely lost within her own madness. She was no longer the composed, calculated and methodical princess she once was, finally descending into pure insanity.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This marks Azula's final appearance in the series. It is stated on Nick's website that after her Agni Kai, Azula was shipped off to a mental health facility on a nearby island where she is monitored around the clock.</p><h2><b>Personality</b></h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like her father, Azula hungers for personal power and is a dedicated nationalist. Harboring a high intolerance of imperfection, Azula relentlessly drills herself towards perfection and settles for nothing less from herself or those that serve her. She believes that power and domination are what makes a person strong. She has absolute confidence in her \"divine right to rule\" which she believes she was born with. She has neither pity nor mercy towards those she marks as treasonous or inferior.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula is marked by a distinct lack of empathy. Even as a child, she was seen to react with hostility when outdone, when she shoved Ty Lee to the ground after Ty Lee had ousted her in gymnastics. This behavior would characterize her relationship with her friends for many years. Although she could show sympathy towards them, she never cared for their feelings and manipulated them as she saw fit, such as when she threatened Ty Lee into leaving the circus and joining her cause. She is prone to asserting herself and her authority in a grandiose way, such as when she humiliated Long Feng in front of his former henchmen, or when she threatened the captain of her ship. She also shows a need for admiration from her father, whom she emulates to a great degree, and to a lesser extent from everyone else around her. She is shown reacting with despair and rage when she learned her father was going to the Earth Kingdom without her. She also becomes very violent (burning down a house) when rejected romantically by Chan. These are all traits of a Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula is marked as one of the cruelest characters in the series. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated sadistic aggression and a near total lack of remorse to friends, servants, family, and animals which suggests that she could be suffering from an antisocial personality disorder. Her own mother, Princess Ursa once remarked, \"What is wrong with that child?” after observing her casual cruelties. Her first reaction to hearing of Iroh's son's death was to wonder whether this now makes her father the heir to the throne. She later dismisses her uncle as a quitter and a loser when learning he had ended his two year siege of Ba Sing Se to grieve for Lu Ten. She eagerly watches Azulon proclaim Ozai's punishment for trying to claim the throne and grins maliciously when Zuko is burned and scarred by their father. She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or her grandfather died. Her cruelty is apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingests the poisonous White Jade flower, both he and Zuko quickly decide that they would rather go seek help from the Earth Kingdom and face certain death than deal with the Fire Nation and be handed over to Azula.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula's characteristic blue flames symbolize the power she possesses and constantly seeks to increase. Her apathy also accounts for her ability to create and direct lightning, the \"cold-blooded fire\". According to Iroh, the skill requires complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track mentality. Despite all of this, she is an excellent tactician, regularly displaying cunning, perception, and resourcefulness that allows her to take advantage of almost any situation. She possesses good self control, facing down Long Feng and deceiving him when held captive, and can lie with a straight face and no physical reactions.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ironically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula does retain some insecurity. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she has developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidates them during conversation. Her overly competitive nature surfaces during a Kuai Ball game, and she later admits her jealously over how much attention Ty Lee receives from others.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, in \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\", Azula begins to show signs of a fragile mentality. As stated above, for all of her self-assurance, she is, for a moment, driven into rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko to escape, and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was in turn temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. The enraged princess then orders both her former friends to be locked away and \"left to rot\". While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting just how unstable she might be.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula's mentality continued to crumble as the series progressed. When she attacked Zuko and the gang at the Western Air Temple during \" The Southern Raiders\", Azula is evidently losing her sanity, as her attacks become far more vicious and is now obsessed with killing Zuko. During her father's coronation as Phoenix King during \" Sozin's Comet, Part 1: The Phoenix King\", Azula is told she will not assist in the attack on the Earth Kingdom. Azula seems distraught at this and takes this decision as an offense to her and her honor. However, she is more than happy to receive the title of Fir e Lord.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the day preceding her coronation, Azula became excessively paranoid, banishing all of her subjects for minor or suspected offenses. When she styles her hair for the coronation, she is so frustrated by her inability to tie up her hair bun that she cuts away her trademark bangs, leaving her hair a tattered mess. She then sees her mother in her mirror in an apparent hallucination. Her mother compliments her, saying that she always had beautiful hair. Azula then asks her mother why she was there, and Ursa tells her that she wouldn't miss her daughter's coronation. Azula tells her not to pretend to act proud, stating that she knew her mother thought she was a monster. The hallucination of her mother then tells her that she doesn't think that, that Azula is just confused, and that she loves her. Azula then goes deeper into insanity, throws her brush at the mirror, breaking it, and breaks down crying. She didn't seem surprised by her hallucination, implying it might not have been the first one.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This incident exposes a complex facet to Azula's persona. Although outwardly maintaining a cold and dismissive opinion of her mother as witnessed in the episode \"The Beach\", Ursa's banishment ultimately had a devastating impact upon Azula's fragile psyche, possibly even more so than it did her brother Zuko. As Azula's mental state began slipping away from her, this inability to reconcile her perceived belief that Ursa considered her a monster with the truer (though idealized) maternal feelings of love and support that Ursa demonstrated in the hallucination created an inescapable conflict in her mind that furthered Azula's eventual mental collapse.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It would also seem that in her ever increasing insanity, Azula gave into her fear of being killed. She accused her servant of purposely leaving a pit in her cherry so that she'll choke. She gets mad at the Dai Li when they arrive five minutes late, suggesting an assassin could sneak in, kill her, and \"be on his merry way\". She then suggests that the Dai Li could betray and kill her (\"just like Mai and Ty Lee\"), and banishes them. She then begins keeping her back against one of the throne's canopy poles, probably out of fear of being attacked or killed from behind.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It also appears that she wasn't sleeping well as she had dark circles under her eyes, implying that she might have feared someone killing her in her sleep. Upon Lo and Li's arrival to counsel her, Azula's fear of disappointing her father is clear and becomes so enraged when her old mentors' question her wishes that she momentarily forgets that they are not firebenders.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula shows up at her coronation impatient and with her hair still a mess. Katara and Zuko then arrive to fight her, and she constantly provokes the duo as she attacks them. When Katara finally defeats Azula and chains her to the ground, Azula screams in anger and breathes fire uncontrollably, struggling to break herself free in extreme rage. She drags herself along the ground helplessly, as Zuko and Katara look on in pity and horror. Throughout the series, Azula appeared to be unaffected by her failure to kill the Avatar, but her failed relationship with her mother (and her jealousy towards Zuko for receiving more of their mother's affection) coupled with the betrayal she suffered at the hands of Mai and Ty Lee (who were the closest persons in her entourage) and her subsequent defeat by Zuko and Katara, finally sends Azula over the edge as she cracks, screaming and crying uncontrollably. Azula is currently in a mental health facility on a nearby island in the Fire Nation where she is closely monitored.</p><h2><b>Abilities</b></h2><h3><b>Firebending</b></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula is one of the most skilled Firebenders in the series, and has been described as a \"prodigy\" by both Ozai and Zuko.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The most noticeable feature of Princess Azula's bending is her ability to create her characteristic blue flames, which are much more intense than the red, orange and yellow fire normally used by Firebenders. Azula is only seen bending normal fire during her childhood and in the opening sequence. In \" Return to Omashu\", Azula was seen using flames in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames, whirling disks, and blades of fire. Also notable is her ability to produce a greater amount of flames than most Firebenders without tiring, as she is shown to be able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She has also demonstrated the skill to condense her flames, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames serve to be rather concussive, able to firmly pulverize objects such as stone. Azula is able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames which can withstand the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks (and a boomerang). She is even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, as was seen during her fight with Aang in \" The Drill\". In \" Appa's Lost Days\", Azula fights off multiple Kyoshi Warriors, using both Firebending and hand-to-hand techniques, and duels Suki. The outcome of this fight is not shown, but the fact Azula, Mai and Ty Lee infiltrated Ba Sing Se posing as the Kyoshi Warriors reveals that Azula won.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The depth of Azula's potential seen thus far came in \" The Crossroads of Destiny\", where she is shown using very advanced techniques, creating large blasts of flame, evaporating a wave of water that Katara threw at her, using her flames to propel herself forward like a jet and minutes later produce and guide lightning. While little of her Firebending was seen in in the earlier stages of Book 3, she does demonstrate her powers a few times. In \" The Beach\", she uses Firebending to give extra propulsion in a game of Kuai Ball, creating an explosion and burning the net. In \" The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse\", she uses her Firebending to break free of her shackles, and briefly attacking Sokka, Aang and Toph. In \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\" Azula engages a pitched battle with Zuko and Sokka. In addition to creating her usual powerful fire balls, she is able to shoot her flames behind her in order to propel herself through the air onto the gondola.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula is one of the most powerful firebenders in the entire series. Only Ozai and Iroh are clearly more powerful than she is, although Zuko is shown to be on approximately equal footing with her towards the end of the series and it is unknown how well Aang would have compared to her. Azula's firebending powers and prodigious skill allow her to fend off many attackers with little effort, and, as is seen in \" The Crossroads of Destiny\", defeat a single talented bender, like Aang.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula is proficient in the highly difficult technique of creating and guiding lightning, a sub-skill of Firebending, and was the first character within the series to demonstrate the ability.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As Azula gradually lost her sanity prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, her firebending became unfocused and wild, making her all the more dangerous, however it also resulted in her becoming exhausted more easily then usual. Despite her state of mind, her attacks on Zuko and Katara during her final duel proved ferocious and destructive, and was still able to fire lightning accurately. However, her mental instability still weakened her battlefield prowess, and this ultimately resulted in her defeat at the hands of Katara. She displayed the ability to breathe fire as she struggled against her chains, but this was only brought about by her madness and rage in her defeat. She can also make fire come out of her ears, but this was most likely due to the power of the comet and her complete mental breakdown.</p><h3><b>Other Skills</b></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula's skills in unarmed combat are displayed several times during the series, most prominently in \" The Avatar State\", \" Appa's Lost Days\", and \"The Day of Black Sun\". She easily avoided Zuko's frenzied knife attacks without the use of Firebending, guiding his hands off course. Later, she proceeded to disarm Suki, and knocked her off her feet without bending. She also has some skill with hidden weaponry, as she has shown the intent to use them during the eclipse. Her acrobatics and use of a hidden shuriken knife are apparently skills she picked up from Mai and Ty Lee. Azula is very agile and in \"The Day of Black Sun\", she has been shown to run up walls and do mid-air twirls. She dodged Aang and Toph's bending attacks with little to no effort using high jumps like Ty Lee. Her physical strength is also surprising as she can support her body in a horizontal position with just her arms with little effort.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula has been shown to be an extremely cunning strategist. When she was a child, she demonstrated her military knowledge by successfully recounting Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle. In \" The Avatar State\", she plans a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which is only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship. In \" The Chase\", she immediately discerns the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail. In \" The Guru\" and \" The Crossroads of Destiny\", she plans and carries out a coup against the Earth King, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation. In \" Nightmares and Daydreams\", she participates in a war meeting with her father and brother. This meeting may or may not have had anything to do with the Eclipse the following day. During The Day of Black Sun, she lays a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the Eclipse time is used up. She also displays the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph can't sense it when she does. In \" The Boiling Rock, Part 2\" she also displayed an innate ability to tell whether someone was telling the truth or not (almost like Toph), stating simply that she was a \"people person\".</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Azula's intelligence makes her skillful in manipulating people. She has used this skill on many people, including Zuko, her mother, Long Feng, the Dai Li, Sokka and even her father.</p>",

Appa and Aang got on very well from the offset, Aang offering Appa an apple. Aang overhearing a decision to separate him from his favorite teacher sent the young Avatar into an emotional state and along with Appa the two inadvertently head into a vicious storm which knocks both into the cold dangerous seas below.  In an act of desperation Aang freezes himself and Appa in a sphere of ice within the water, saving both of the them, but sealing them with an ice prison. <br/><br/><h2>Major Story Arcs </h2><b>Early Life</b><br/> <p>Following the traditions of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-48049\" href=\"/air-nomads/4060-48049/\" slug=\"air-nomads\">Air Nomads</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47646\" href=\"/aang/4005-47646/\" slug=\"aang\">Aang</a> was brought to the Eastern Air temple to choose a sky bison cub.
